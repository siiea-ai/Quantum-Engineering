## The Story Behind This Curriculum

> *"I always wanted to continue my education in quantum physics and engineering, but I didn't have the time to sit in a university for years. So I decided to build my own path."*
>
> — **Imran Ali**, Founder of Siiea Innovations, LLC

This repository represents a deeply personal journey. As an entrepreneur running a technology company, I faced a choice that many professionals encounter: abandon my dream of studying quantum science at the highest level, or find another way.

I chose to create my own way.

What you're looking at is a **complete, 6-year, 10,000+ hour curriculum** covering graduate-level quantum science and engineering. Every day file, every problem set, every computational lab was carefully researched and structured to cover topics comparable to those taught at leading university programs.

**This is not a shortcut.** It's the same rigorous material—just organized for someone who learns on their own schedule.

## What Makes This Different

### Topics Aligned With Leading Programs

This curriculum covers topics comparable to those in:

| University | Reference Courses | Coverage |
|------------|-----------------|----------|
| **Harvard** | QSE 200, QSE 201, Physics 143a/b | Comprehensive |
| **MIT** | 8.04, 8.05, 8.06, 8.370x | Comprehensive |
| **Caltech** | Ph125abc, Ph219 | Substantial |
| **Princeton** | PHY 521, PHY 522 | Substantial |
| **Stanford** | PHYSICS 130, 131 | Comprehensive |

### Structured for Self-Study

Each day follows a consistent 7-hour structure:

| Block | Time | Duration | Activity |
|-------|------|----------|----------|
| Morning | 9:00 AM - 12:30 PM | 3.5 hours | Theory & Derivations |
| Afternoon | 2:00 PM - 4:30 PM | 2.5 hours | Problem Solving |
| Evening | 7:00 PM - 8:00 PM | 1 hour | Computational Lab |

### Every Topic Connected to Quantum Mechanics

From Day 1 of calculus to Day 2016 of thesis defense, every classical concept is explicitly connected to its quantum mechanical application. You never learn something without understanding *why* it matters for quantum science.

## Interactive Jupyter Notebooks (Coming Soon)

The curriculum is being expanded with **runnable Jupyter notebooks** for every computational lab — turning static markdown into live, executable science.

### What's Coming

| Component | Description | Status |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| **Year 0 Notebooks** | ~96 notebooks: linear algebra, ODE solvers, classical mechanics, group theory | Planned |
| **Year 1 Notebooks** | ~96 notebooks: wave functions, Bloch sphere, Qiskit circuits, entanglement | Planned |
| **Year 2 Notebooks** | ~96 notebooks: error correction, surface codes, fault tolerance, noise models | Planned |
| **MLX Labs** | Apple Silicon-optimized quantum simulation and quantum ML experiments | Planned |

### Apple MLX Integration

This project is being developed on an **Apple Mac Studio (M-series, 512GB unified memory)**, enabling quantum simulations at scales most personal machines can't reach:

| Qubits | State Vector Size | Feasibility (512GB) |
|--------|-------------------|---------------------|
| 20 | 16 MB | Trivial |
| 25 | 512 MB | Easy |
| 30 | 16 GB | Comfortable |
| 33 | 128 GB | Feasible |
| 35 | 512 GB | At the limit |

The MLX Labs will include:
- **Quantum neural network decoders** — train ML models for error correction
- **Variational quantum eigensolvers** — hybrid classical-quantum optimization
- **Quantum kernel methods** — quantum-enhanced machine learning
- **Large-scale state vector simulation** — push beyond 30 qubits locally

## Philosophy

### Quality Over Speed

This curriculum emphasizes deep understanding over rapid completion:

1. **Derivations, Not Just Formulas** — Know *why* equations work
2. **Quantum Connections Throughout** — Every classical concept linked to QM
3. **Modern Applications** — Current research and future directions
4. **Computational Literacy** — Python/Qiskit implementations throughout
5. **Research Preparation** — Building toward original contributions

### The Long Game

A PhD takes 5-6 years for a reason. This curriculum respects that timeline. You're not racing to a certificate—you're building genuine expertise that will last a lifetime.

---

## Who This Is For

- **Working professionals** who can't attend traditional PhD programs
- **Self-learners** who want world-class quantum education

## How This Compares

After extensive research, **no other open-source project offers anything close to this scope.** Here's how the landscape breaks down:

| Project | Type | Scope | Original Content |
|---------|------|-------|------------------|
| **This Curriculum** | Day-by-day curriculum | 6 years, 2,016 days | Yes — all lessons, problems, labs |
| OSSU Computer Science | Course link list | CS degree (no quantum) | No — links only |
| Microsoft QuantumKatas | Coding exercises | Single semester, Q# only | Yes — but archived |
| Qiskit Textbook | Jupyter notebooks | Quantum algorithms only | Yes — vendor-locked to IBM |
| awesome-quantum-computing | Link aggregation | Broad but shallow | No — directory only |
| NVIDIA CUDA-Q Academic | GPU quantum labs | Narrow HPC focus | Yes — vendor-specific |

**What no one else does:**
1. Day-by-day structure across 2,016 days
2. Full mathematical foundations from calculus (Year 0)
3. 6-year PhD-equivalent scope in a single repository
4. Integrated research training with thesis preparation (Years 4-5)
5. Deep error correction and fault tolerance coverage (Year 2-3)
6. Qualifying exam simulation (Year 3)
7. Framework-agnostic Python — not locked to any vendor
8. Self-contained — all theory, derivations, and code in the repository itself
