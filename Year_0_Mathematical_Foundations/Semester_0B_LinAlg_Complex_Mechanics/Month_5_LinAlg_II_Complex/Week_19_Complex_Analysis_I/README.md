# Week 19: Complex Analysis I — Foundations of Analytic Function Theory

## 📋 Overview

**Week 19** (Days 127-133) introduces **Complex Analysis**, one of the most beautiful and powerful branches of mathematics with profound applications to quantum mechanics. This week establishes the foundations: complex functions, analyticity, and Cauchy's theorem.

**Total Study Time:** ~49 hours (7 hours/day × 7 days)

## 🔑 Key Theorems

### Cauchy-Riemann Equations
For f(z) = u(x,y) + iv(x,y) to be differentiable:
$$\frac{\partial u}{\partial x} = \frac{\partial v}{\partial y}, \quad \frac{\partial u}{\partial y} = -\frac{\partial v}{\partial x}$$

### Cauchy's Theorem
If f is analytic on and inside a closed contour γ:
$$\oint_\gamma f(z)\,dz = 0$$

### Cauchy's Integral Formula
If f is analytic inside γ and z₀ is inside γ:
$$f(z_0) = \frac{1}{2\pi i}\oint_\gamma \frac{f(z)}{z-z_0}\,dz$$
