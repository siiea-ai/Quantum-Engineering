## 🔑 Key Theorems

### Noether's Theorem
Every continuous symmetry → conserved quantity
$$I = \sum_i p_i Q_i - h\tau = \text{const}$$

### Kepler's Laws
1. Elliptical orbits with Sun at focus
2. Equal areas in equal times (L = const)
3. T² ∝ a³

### Normal Modes
$$\det(\mathbf{K} - \omega^2\mathbf{M}) = 0$$
