# Week 21: Lagrangian Mechanics I — Foundations

## 📋 Overview

**Week 21** (Days 141-147) introduces the Lagrangian formulation of classical mechanics — a revolutionary approach that replaces Newton's vector equations with a single scalar principle.

**Total Study Time:** ~49 hours (7 hours/day × 7 days)

## 🎯 Week Learning Objectives

By the end of this week, you will be able to:

1. Define and use generalized coordinates
2. Count degrees of freedom and classify constraints
3. State and apply the Principle of Least Action
4. Derive and solve Euler-Lagrange equations
5. Use Lagrange multipliers for constrained systems
6. Connect symmetries to conservation laws

## 🔑 Key Formulas

### Fundamental Equations
$$L = T - V \quad \text{(Lagrangian)}$$

$$S = \int_{t_1}^{t_2} L\,dt \quad \text{(Action)}$$

$$\frac{d}{dt}\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}_i} - \frac{\partial L}{\partial q_i} = 0 \quad \text{(Euler-Lagrange)}$$

### Conservation Laws
| Symmetry | Conserved Quantity |
|----------|-------------------|
| Time translation | Energy |
| Space translation | Momentum |
| Rotation | Angular momentum |

## 🔬 Physics Connections

| Classical Concept | Quantum Analog |
|-------------------|----------------|
| Action S | Phase e^{iS/ℏ} in path integral |
| Euler-Lagrange | Schrödinger equation (classical limit) |
| Symmetry → Conservation | [Ĥ, Î] = 0 |
