# Month 4: Linear Algebra I

## Overview
**Duration:** Days 85-112 (28 days, 4 weeks)
**Focus:** Core linear algebra essential for quantum mechanics

Linear algebra is the mathematical language of quantum mechanics. Every quantum state is a vector, every observable is an operator, and measurements correspond to eigenvalue problems. This month builds the foundation you'll use throughout your quantum physics studies.

### Why Linear Algebra?

| Linear Algebra Concept | Quantum Mechanics Application |
|------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Vector space | State space (Hilbert space) |
| Vector | Quantum state \|ψ⟩ |
| Basis | Complete set of states |
| Linear combination | Superposition |
| Linear operator | Quantum observable, evolution |
| Eigenvalue | Measurement outcome |
| Eigenvector | State after measurement |
| Inner product | Probability amplitude ⟨φ\|ψ⟩ |

### The Central Paradigm

In quantum mechanics:
- Physical states are vectors in a Hilbert space
- Physical observables are Hermitian operators
- Measurements yield eigenvalues
- Probabilities come from inner products

Everything in this month directly prepares you for this framework.
