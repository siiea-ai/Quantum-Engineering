## 📊 Key Concepts by Week

### Week 5: Vectors and Space
- Vector operations (addition, scalar multiplication)
- Dot product: **a** · **b** = |**a**||**b**|cos θ
- Cross product: **a** × **b** (perpendicular, area)
- Lines, planes, quadric surfaces

### Week 6: Partial Derivatives
- Partial derivatives: ∂f/∂x, ∂f/∂y
- Gradient: ∇f = ⟨fₓ, fᵧ⟩
- Directional derivative: D_**u**f = ∇f · **u**
- Tangent planes: z = f(a,b) + fₓ(x-a) + fᵧ(y-b)

### Week 7: Multiple Integrals
- Double integrals: ∬_R f dA
- Polar: dA = r dr dθ
- Triple integrals: ∭_E f dV
- Applications: mass, center of mass, moments

### Week 8: Vector Calculus

- Second-order linear ODEs (homogeneous, nonhomogeneous)
- Systems of ODEs
- Laplace transforms

Differential equations describe how quantum systems evolve—the Schrödinger equation is a differential equation!

## 📝 Study Tips

1. **Visualize everything** - Use Python to plot surfaces, vector fields, regions
2. **Master coordinate systems** - Know when to use Cartesian, polar, cylindrical, spherical
3. **Practice setting up integrals** - The setup is often harder than evaluation
4. **Understand the theorems** - They connect boundaries to interiors
5. **Review Week 1-4 integration** - Multiple integrals build on single-variable integration
