# Week 06: Partial Derivatives

## 📋 Overview

This week introduces differentiation for functions of multiple variables. You'll learn to compute partial derivatives, understand the gradient as a vector pointing toward steepest ascent, and use linearization for approximation.

**Duration:** 7 days  
**Total Study Time:** ~45 hours  
**Difficulty:** Intermediate-Advanced

## 📊 Key Formulas

### Partial Derivatives
$$f_x = \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}, \quad f_y = \frac{\partial f}{\partial y}$$

### Gradient
$$\nabla f = \langle f_x, f_y \rangle$$

### Directional Derivative
$$D_\mathbf{u}f = \nabla f \cdot \mathbf{u}$$

### Tangent Plane
$$z = f(a,b) + f_x(a,b)(x-a) + f_y(a,b)(y-b)$$

### Chain Rule
$$\frac{dz}{dt} = \frac{\partial z}{\partial x}\frac{dx}{dt} + \frac{\partial z}{\partial y}\frac{dy}{dt}$$
