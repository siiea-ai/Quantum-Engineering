## 📊 Key Formulas

### Vectors
- Magnitude: $|\mathbf{v}| = \sqrt{v_1^2 + v_2^2 + v_3^2}$
- Unit vector: $\hat{\mathbf{v}} = \mathbf{v}/|\mathbf{v}|$

### Dot Product
- $\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} = a_1b_1 + a_2b_2 + a_3b_3 = |\mathbf{a}||\mathbf{b}|\cos\theta$

### Cross Product
- $|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}| = |\mathbf{a}||\mathbf{b}|\sin\theta$
- Result is perpendicular to both vectors

### Lines and Planes
- Line: $\mathbf{r}(t) = \mathbf{r}_0 + t\mathbf{v}$
- Plane: $ax + by + cz = d$
