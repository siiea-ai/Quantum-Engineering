## 📝 Week 8 Summary Sheet

### Vector Fields
$$\mathbf{F}(x, y, z) = \langle P, Q, R \rangle$$

### Divergence
$$\text{div } \mathbf{F} = \nabla \cdot \mathbf{F} = \frac{\partial P}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial Q}{\partial y} + \frac{\partial R}{\partial z}$$

### Curl
$$\text{curl } \mathbf{F} = \nabla \times \mathbf{F} = \left\langle \frac{\partial R}{\partial y} - \frac{\partial Q}{\partial z}, \frac{\partial P}{\partial z} - \frac{\partial R}{\partial x}, \frac{\partial Q}{\partial x} - \frac{\partial P}{\partial y} \right\rangle$$

### Line Integrals
$$\int_C \mathbf{F} \cdot d\mathbf{r} = \int_a^b \mathbf{F}(\mathbf{r}(t)) \cdot \mathbf{r}'(t) \, dt$$

### Green's Theorem
$$\oint_C P \, dx + Q \, dy = \iint_D \left(\frac{\partial Q}{\partial x} - \frac{\partial P}{\partial y}\right) dA$$

### Stokes' Theorem
$$\oint_C \mathbf{F} \cdot d\mathbf{r} = \iint_S (\nabla \times \mathbf{F}) \cdot d\mathbf{S}$$

### Divergence Theorem
$$\iint_S \mathbf{F} \cdot d\mathbf{S} = \iiint_E \nabla \cdot \mathbf{F} \, dV$$

## 🔜 Month 3 Preview: Ordinary Differential Equations

### The Big Picture

Differential equations describe how things change—the foundation of physics, engineering, and quantum mechanics.

$$\frac{dy}{dx} = f(x, y)$$

### Topics Coming Up

**Week 9:** First-Order ODEs
- Separable equations
- Linear first-order equations
- Exact equations
- Applications (growth, decay, cooling)

**Week 10:** Second-Order Linear ODEs
- Homogeneous equations
- Characteristic equation
- Undetermined coefficients
- Variation of parameters

**Week 11:** Systems of ODEs
- Systems as matrices
- Eigenvalue methods
- Phase portraits

**Week 12:** Series Solutions & Laplace Transforms
- Power series solutions
- Laplace transforms
- Applications to engineering problems

### Why This Matters for Quantum

The Schrödinger equation is a differential equation:
$$i\hbar\frac{\partial \Psi}{\partial t} = \hat{H}\Psi$$

Time-independent form:
$$\hat{H}\psi = E\psi$$

Every quantum system you'll study requires solving differential equations!
