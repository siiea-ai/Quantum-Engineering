# Week 04: Integration

## 📋 Overview

This week introduces the integral—the second pillar of calculus. You'll learn to "undo" differentiation, calculate areas, and discover the profound connection between derivatives and integrals.

**Duration:** 7 days  
**Total Study Time:** ~45 hours  
**Difficulty:** Intermediate

## 📊 Key Formulas

### Antiderivatives
$$\int x^n \, dx = \frac{x^{n+1}}{n+1} + C \quad (n \neq -1)$$

### Fundamental Theorem
**Part 1:** $\frac{d}{dx}\int_a^x f(t) \, dt = f(x)$

**Part 2:** $\int_a^b f(x) \, dx = F(b) - F(a)$

### Substitution
$$\int f(g(x))g'(x) \, dx = \int f(u) \, du$$
where u = g(x)
