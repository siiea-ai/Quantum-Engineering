## 📊 Key Formulas

### The Derivative Definition
$$f'(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}$$

### Basic Rules
| Rule | Formula |
|------|---------|
| Power | d/dx[xⁿ] = nxⁿ⁻¹ |
| Product | (fg)' = f'g + fg' |
| Quotient | (f/g)' = (f'g - fg')/g² |
| Chain | d/dx[f(g(x))] = f'(g(x))·g'(x) |

### Special Derivatives
| Function | Derivative |
|----------|------------|
| eˣ | eˣ |
| ln(x) | 1/x |
| sin(x) | cos(x) |
| cos(x) | -sin(x) |
