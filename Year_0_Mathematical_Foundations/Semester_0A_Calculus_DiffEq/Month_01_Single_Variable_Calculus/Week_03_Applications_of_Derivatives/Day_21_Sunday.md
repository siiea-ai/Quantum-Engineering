## 📝 Week 3 Summary Sheet

### Related Rates Strategy
1. Draw diagram, label variables
2. Write equation relating variables
3. Differentiate with respect to time t
4. Substitute known values AFTER differentiating
5. Solve for unknown rate

### Linear Approximation
$$f(x) \approx f(a) + f'(a)(x - a)$$

### Differentials
$$dy = f'(x) \cdot dx$$

### Finding Extrema
**Critical points:** Where f'(x) = 0 or f'(x) DNE

**Closed Interval Method:**
1. Find critical points in (a, b)
2. Evaluate f at critical points and endpoints
3. Compare values

**First Derivative Test:**
- f' changes + to − → local max
- f' changes − to + → local min

**Second Derivative Test:**
- f''(c) > 0 → local min
- f''(c) < 0 → local max

### Optimization Strategy
1. Identify objective function
2. Write constraints
3. Reduce to single variable
4. Find critical points
5. Verify max/min

### L'Hôpital's Rule
For 0/0 or ∞/∞ forms:
$$\lim \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \lim \frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)}$$

### Newton's Method
$$x_{n+1} = x_n - \frac{f(x_n)}{f'(x_n)}$$

## 🔄 Self-Assessment Quiz

**Q1:** Water fills a conical tank at 3 m³/min. If height = 2 × radius, find dh/dt when h = 4m.

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
V = (1/3)πr²h = (1/12)πh³
dV/dt = (1/4)πh²(dh/dt)
3 = (1/4)π(16)(dh/dt)
dh/dt = 3/(4π) m/min
</details>

**Q2:** Find critical points of f(x) = x⁴ - 4x³.

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
f'(x) = 4x³ - 12x² = 4x²(x - 3)
Critical points: x = 0 and x = 3
</details>

**Q3:** Evaluate: $\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{e^x - 1 - x}{x^2}$

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
Using L'Hôpital twice:
= lim (eˣ - 1)/(2x) = lim eˣ/2 = 1/2
</details>

## 🔜 Week 4 Preview: Integration

### The Big Picture

We've learned to find rates of change (derivatives). Now we reverse the process:

**Given:** The rate of change f'(x)
**Find:** The original function f(x)

This is **antidifferentiation** or **integration**.

### Topics Coming Up

**Day 22:** Antiderivatives
- Reversing differentiation
- Basic antiderivative rules

**Day 23:** Area and the Definite Integral
- Riemann sums
- Area under curves

**Day 24:** The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus
- The profound connection between derivatives and integrals

**Day 25:** Integration Techniques I
- Substitution method

**Day 26:** Week 4 Problem Set

**Day 27:** Computational Lab

**Day 28:** Rest and Review

### Key Formulas Preview

| Derivative | Antiderivative |
|------------|----------------|
| xⁿ | x^(n+1)/(n+1) + C |
| cos(x) | sin(x) + C |
| sin(x) | -cos(x) + C |
| eˣ | eˣ + C |
| 1/x | ln|x| + C |

### Quantum Mechanics Connection

Integration is essential in QM:
- Normalization: ∫|ψ|² dx = 1
- Expectation values: ⟨x⟩ = ∫ψ* x ψ dx
- Probability: P(a < x < b) = ∫ₐᵇ |ψ|² dx
