## 📊 Key Formulas

### Related Rates
Differentiate implicitly with respect to t:
$$\frac{d}{dt}[\text{equation}]$$

### Linear Approximation
$$f(x) \approx f(a) + f'(a)(x-a)$$

### Optimization
1. Objective function → differentiate
2. Set f'(x) = 0 → solve for critical points
3. Test for max/min

### L'Hôpital's Rule
$$\lim_{x \to a} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \lim_{x \to a} \frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)}$$ (for 0/0 or ∞/∞)

### Newton's Method
$$x_{n+1} = x_n - \frac{f(x_n)}{f'(x_n)}$$
