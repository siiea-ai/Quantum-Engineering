# Week 01: Limits and Continuity

## 📋 Overview

This week establishes the foundational concepts of calculus: limits and continuity. These ideas form the basis for all of calculus and are essential for understanding quantum mechanics.

**Duration:** 7 days  
**Total Study Time:** ~45 hours  
**Difficulty:** Beginner to Intermediate
