## 📝 Week 12 Summary Sheet

### The Laplace Transform

$$\mathcal{L}\{f(t)\} = F(s) = \int_0^\infty f(t)e^{-st} dt$$

### Essential Transform Table

| $f(t)$ | $F(s)$ |
|--------|--------|
| $1$ | $1/s$ |
| $t^n$ | $n!/s^{n+1}$ |
| $e^{at}$ | $1/(s-a)$ |
| $\sin(\omega t)$ | $\omega/(s^2+\omega^2)$ |
| $\cos(\omega t)$ | $s/(s^2+\omega^2)$ |
| $u(t-c)$ | $e^{-cs}/s$ |
| $\delta(t-c)$ | $e^{-cs}$ |

### Key Properties

| Property | Formula |
|----------|---------|
| Linearity | $\mathcal{L}\{af+bg\} = aF + bG$ |
| s-Shifting | $\mathcal{L}\{e^{at}f\} = F(s-a)$ |
| t-Shifting | $\mathcal{L}\{u(t-c)f(t-c)\} = e^{-cs}F(s)$ |
| Derivative | $\mathcal{L}\{f'\} = sF - f(0)$ |
| Integral | $\mathcal{L}\{\int f\} = F/s$ |

### Solution Method

1. **Transform:** Apply $\mathcal{L}$ to ODE
2. **Solve:** Find $Y(s)$ algebraically
3. **Invert:** Use partial fractions, find $y(t)$
