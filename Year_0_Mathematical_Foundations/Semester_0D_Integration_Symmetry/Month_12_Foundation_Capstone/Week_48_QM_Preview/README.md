# Week 48: Quantum Mechanics Preview

## Overview

**Month 12, Week 48 (Days 330-336)**

This final week of Year 0 introduces quantum mechanics concepts and prepares you for Year 1. We preview the mathematical structure, postulates, and interpretation of quantum mechanics.

## Daily Schedule

| Day | Topic |
|-----|-------|
| 330 | Quantum Mechanics Motivation |
| 331 | Mathematical Structure of QM |
| 332 | The Postulates of QM |
| 333 | Simple Systems Preview |
| 334 | Interpretation and Philosophy |
| 335 | Year 1 Roadmap |
| 336 | Year 0 Conclusion |

## Key Concepts

### The Quantum World
- Wave-particle duality
- Uncertainty principle
- Superposition
- Measurement problem

### Mathematical Framework
- Hilbert spaces
- Linear operators
- Eigenvalue problems
- Commutators

### The Postulates
1. States are vectors in Hilbert space
2. Observables are Hermitian operators
3. Measurement yields eigenvalues
4. Time evolution is unitary
