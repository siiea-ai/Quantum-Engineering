# Day 330: Quantum Mechanics Motivation

## Overview

**Month 12, Week 48, Day 1 — Monday**

Today we explore why quantum mechanics was necessary: the failures of classical physics in explaining atomic phenomena, and the revolutionary experiments that demanded a new framework.

## Learning Objectives

1. Understand the historical crises of classical physics
2. Know the key experiments that led to quantum mechanics
3. Appreciate the revolutionary nature of quantum theory
4. Prepare for the mathematical formalism

## 1. The Classical Crisis (1900)

### Successes of Classical Physics

By 1900, physics seemed complete:
- Newton's mechanics
- Maxwell's electromagnetism
- Thermodynamics and statistical mechanics

### The Problems

1. **Blackbody radiation:** Classical theory predicted infinite energy (ultraviolet catastrophe)
2. **Photoelectric effect:** Light energy depends on frequency, not intensity
3. **Atomic stability:** Electrons should spiral into nucleus
4. **Atomic spectra:** Discrete lines, not continuous

## 2. Revolutionary Experiments

### Planck's Blackbody Solution (1900)

Energy quantization: $E = nh\nu$

$$\boxed{E = h\nu}$$

This was the birth of quantum theory.

### Einstein's Photoelectric Effect (1905)

Light comes in quanta (photons): $E_{photon} = h\nu$

$$E_{kinetic} = h\nu - \phi$$

### Bohr Model (1913)

Quantized orbits: $L = n\hbar$

Energy levels: $E_n = -13.6/n^2$ eV

### de Broglie Waves (1924)

Matter has wavelength: $\lambda = h/p$

### Davisson-Germer (1927)

Electron diffraction confirmed wave nature of matter.

## 3. The New Physics

### Wave-Particle Duality

Everything exhibits both wave and particle properties:
- Light: photons with $E = h\nu$
- Matter: waves with $\lambda = h/p$

### Uncertainty Principle (Heisenberg, 1927)

$$\boxed{\Delta x \cdot \Delta p \geq \frac{\hbar}{2}}$$

Fundamental limit on knowledge, not measurement error.

### Superposition

Quantum systems can exist in multiple states simultaneously until measured.

---

## 4. Why Classical Physics Fails

### The Double-Slit Experiment

- Particles: Two bands
- Waves: Interference pattern
- Electrons: Interference pattern (wave behavior)
- But detected as particles!

### The Measurement Problem

The act of measurement changes the system fundamentally.

## 5. Key Quantum Features

| Feature | Classical | Quantum |
|---------|-----------|---------|
| States | Definite $(q, p)$ | Superposition $|\psi\rangle$ |
| Measurement | Reveals pre-existing value | Creates value |
| Determinism | Yes | No (probabilities only) |
| Interference | Waves only | All matter |

---

## Summary

### The Quantum Revolution

$$\boxed{\text{Classical: Deterministic, Continuous} \to \text{Quantum: Probabilistic, Discrete}}$$

### Key Equations

- Planck: $E = h\nu$
- de Broglie: $\lambda = h/p$
- Heisenberg: $\Delta x \Delta p \geq \hbar/2$
