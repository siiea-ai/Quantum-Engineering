## Example Presentation: QHO Simulator

### Slide 1: Title
**Quantum Harmonic Oscillator Simulator**

A comprehensive implementation integrating:
- Analytical methods (Hermite polynomials)
- Numerical methods (finite differences)
- Phase space representation (Wigner functions)

### Slide 2: Year 0 Integration

| Year 0 Topic | Application |
|--------------|-------------|
| Calculus | Integration, special functions |
| Linear algebra | Eigenvalue problems |
| Differential equations | Schrödinger equation |
| Complex analysis | Wave functions |
| Group theory | Ladder operators, SU(1,1) |

### Slide 3: Key Results

1. **Eigenfunctions match analytical solutions** (error < 0.01%)
2. **Numerical eigenvalues accurate** (error < 1%)
3. **Time evolution conserves probability**
4. **Wigner functions show quantum-classical correspondence**

### Slide 4: What I Learned

- Connecting abstract mathematics to physical systems
- Numerical methods for quantum mechanics
- Importance of validation and testing
- Scientific computing best practices
