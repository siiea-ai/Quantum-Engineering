## Overview

**Duration:** Months 10-12 (Days 253-336, 84 days total)
**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE** (84/84 days)
**Focus:** Computational skills, symmetry principles, and comprehensive integration

This final semester of Year 0 brings together computational proficiency, the crucial topic of group theory and symmetries, and a comprehensive capstone that integrates all mathematical foundations before transitioning to quantum mechanics.

## Monthly Structure

### Month 10: Scientific Computing for Physics (Days 253-280)

**Resources:** NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, SymPy, Jupyter

| Week | Days | Topic | Application |
|------|------|-------|-------------|
| 37 | 253-259 | Python Foundations, NumPy | Numerical linear algebra |
| 38 | 260-266 | SciPy: ODEs, Optimization, Integration | Physics simulations |
| 39 | 267-273 | Visualization, Jupyter Workflows | Publication-quality figures |
| 40 | 274-280 | Physics Simulations Capstone | Classical → Quantum preview |

**Why Important:** Computational literacy is essential for modern research. This month consolidates the Python skills scattered throughout previous months into systematic proficiency.

### Month 11: Group Theory & Symmetries (Days 281-308) ⭐ CRITICAL

**Textbooks:** Tinkham (QM applications), Brian Hall (Lie theory)

| Week | Days | Topic | QM Connection |
|------|------|-------|---------------|
| 41 | 281-287 | Abstract Groups, Subgroups | Symmetry classification |
| 42 | 288-294 | Representation Theory, Schur's Lemma | Quantum states under symmetry |
| 43 | 295-301 | Lie Groups: SO(3), SU(2) | Rotations, spin |
| 44 | 302-308 | Angular Momentum, Clebsch-Gordan | Addition of angular momenta |

**Why Critical:** Symmetry is THE organizing principle of modern physics. Group theory explains:
- Why angular momentum is quantized
- Selection rules for transitions
- Classification of particles
- Conservation laws (Noether's theorem revisited)

### Month 12: Foundation Year Capstone (Days 309-336)

| Week | Days | Topic | Purpose |
|------|------|-------|---------|
| 45 | 309-315 | Mathematics Comprehensive Review | Synthesis & self-assessment |
| 46 | 316-322 | Physics Comprehensive Review | Synthesis & self-assessment |
| 47 | 323-329 | Computational Capstone Project | Integrated simulation project |
| 48 | 330-336 | QM Preview & Year 1 Preparation | Transition to quantum mechanics |

**Purpose:** Integrates all Year 0 knowledge, identifies gaps, and prepares for Year 1 Quantum Mechanics Core.

## Why This Semester Matters

### Group Theory: The Missing Ingredient

Most physics programs either skip group theory entirely or teach it superficially within quantum mechanics. This creates problems:

| Problem | Impact |
|---------|--------|
| Angular momentum algebra seems arbitrary | Without SU(2), ladder operators are magic |
| Selection rules are memorized | Without representation theory, no understanding |
| Particle physics is incomprehensible | Standard Model IS group theory |

### The Caltech Requirement

Caltech explicitly requires group theory before advanced quantum mechanics. Month 11 addresses this gap.

### Computational Competency

Modern quantum research requires:
- Numerical simulation of quantum systems
- Visualization of wave functions and operators
- Statistical analysis of measurement data
- Interface with quantum computing frameworks

Month 10 consolidates computational skills for research-level work.
