## Key Insights

1. **Green's functions encode all physics** — poles give discrete states, cuts give continua.

2. **Causality = Analyticity** — response functions analytic in upper half-plane.

3. **S-matrix analyticity** determines all scattering information.

4. **Saddle point** connects quantum and classical mechanics.

5. **Special functions** appear everywhere in physics calculations.
