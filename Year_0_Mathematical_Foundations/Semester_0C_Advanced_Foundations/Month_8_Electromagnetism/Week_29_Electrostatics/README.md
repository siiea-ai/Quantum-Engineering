# Week 29: Electrostatics

## Overview

**Days:** 197-203 (7 days)
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE
**Focus:** Static electric fields, potentials, and boundary value problems

This week establishes the foundations of electrostatics: Coulomb's law, Gauss's law, electrostatic potential, and techniques for solving Laplace's and Poisson's equations. These tools are essential for understanding the hydrogen atom's Coulomb potential.
