# Week 30: Magnetostatics

## Overview

**Days:** 204-210 (7 days)
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE
**Focus:** Static magnetic fields, Ampère's law, and magnetic dipoles

This week covers magnetostatics: the Lorentz force, Biot-Savart law, Ampère's law, and magnetic dipole moments. Understanding magnetic fields is essential for electron spin and the magnetic properties of atoms.
