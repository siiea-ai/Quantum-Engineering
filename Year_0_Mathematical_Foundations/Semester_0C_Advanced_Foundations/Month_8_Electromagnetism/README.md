# Month 8: Electromagnetism

## Overview

**Duration:** Days 197-224 (28 days)
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE
**Focus:** Classical electrodynamics as foundation for quantum electrodynamics

This month covers classical electromagnetism from electrostatics through Maxwell's equations and special relativity. Understanding classical E&M is essential for quantum field theory, where photons emerge as quantized electromagnetic waves.

## Essential Formulas

### Electrostatics
$$\nabla \cdot \mathbf{E} = \frac{\rho}{\varepsilon_0}, \quad \nabla \times \mathbf{E} = 0$$
$$\mathbf{E} = -\nabla \phi, \quad \nabla^2 \phi = -\frac{\rho}{\varepsilon_0}$$

### Magnetostatics
$$\nabla \cdot \mathbf{B} = 0, \quad \nabla \times \mathbf{B} = \mu_0 \mathbf{J}$$
$$\mathbf{B} = \nabla \times \mathbf{A}$$

### Maxwell's Equations
$$\nabla \cdot \mathbf{E} = \frac{\rho}{\varepsilon_0}, \quad \nabla \times \mathbf{E} = -\frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t}$$
$$\nabla \cdot \mathbf{B} = 0, \quad \nabla \times \mathbf{B} = \mu_0 \mathbf{J} + \mu_0 \varepsilon_0 \frac{\partial \mathbf{E}}{\partial t}$$

### Special Relativity
$$ds^2 = -c^2 dt^2 + dx^2 + dy^2 + dz^2$$
$$F^{\mu\nu} = \partial^\mu A^\nu - \partial^\nu A^\mu$$

## Key Insights

1. **E&M is the first successful field theory** — all forces mediated by fields.

2. **Maxwell unified electricity, magnetism, and optics** — light is an electromagnetic wave.

3. **Special relativity emerged from E&M** — Maxwell's equations are already relativistic.

4. **Quantizing E&M gives QED** — the most precise theory in physics.

5. **Gauge invariance first appears here** — foundation of all modern particle physics.
