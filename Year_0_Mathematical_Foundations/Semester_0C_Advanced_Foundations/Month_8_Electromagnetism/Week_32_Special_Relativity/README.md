# Week 32: Special Relativity and Electromagnetism

## Overview

**Days:** 218-224 (7 days)
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE
**Focus:** Special relativity, Lorentz transformations, and covariant electrodynamics

This week unifies electromagnetism with special relativity, revealing that electric and magnetic fields are different aspects of a single electromagnetic field tensor. Understanding relativistic electrodynamics is essential for particle physics, QED, and high-energy phenomena.

*"The views of space and time which I wish to lay before you have sprung from the soil of experimental physics, and therein lies their strength. They are radical. Henceforth space by itself, and time by itself, are doomed to fade away into mere shadows, and only a kind of union of the two will preserve an independent reality."*
— Hermann Minkowski, 1908

**Week 32 connects to Year 1:** Special relativity is foundational for quantum field theory. The Dirac equation emerges from demanding a first-order relativistic wave equation, predicting antimatter and explaining spin as a relativistic effect.
