## The Clerk Who Wanted to Understand the Universe

In 2000, I was a clerk.

Not a physicist. Not an engineer. Not a student at MIT or Harvard. A clerk—counting inventory, learning cash registers, working alongside my family in the convenience store business in Houston, Texas.

I was 22 years old, and I had a secret: I wanted to understand how the universe actually works.

Not the inspirational poster version. Not the "quantum means infinite possibilities" nonsense you see on Instagram. I wanted the real thing—the mathematics, the wave functions, the operators and eigenvalues that describe reality at its most fundamental level.

But I had bills to pay. A family counting on me. No money for university. No time for classrooms.

So I did what millions of people do with their dreams: I put it in a drawer and got to work.

---

## Twenty-Five Years in the Making

For the next two decades, I built a different kind of life.

I went from clerk to dispatcher at fuel distribution companies. I learned operations, logistics, how businesses actually run. In 2009, I opened my first convenience store. Then another. Then another.

Today, I'm Managing Partner of **Movement Fuels, LLC**—35 stores across Houston and Austin. I serve as President of the **Greater Houston Retailers Cooperative Association (GHRA)**, representing over 2,000 independently owned stores across 37 Texas counties.

I built a business. I built a reputation. I built a family.

But that drawer? It never fully closed.

Every documentary about quantum computing. Every article about Google achieving "quantum supremacy." Every headline about IBM's latest quantum processor. I read them all. And every time, I felt the same quiet pull—the dream that wouldn't stay buried.

---

## The Moment Everything Changed

About a year ago, something changed my direction.

I was reminded that the search for knowledge doesn't have an expiration date. That understanding the world—through science, through technology, through rigorous inquiry—is not separate from living a meaningful life. It *is* living a meaningful life.

I took this seriously.

I started reading everything I could about AI. Articles. Books. Research papers. I attended seminars. I watched hundreds of hours of lectures. I tested local GPT models, asked them coding questions, tried to understand not just *what* these systems could do, but *how* they actually worked.

And somewhere in that journey, a thought began forming:

*What if AI could help me finally pursue the dream I'd been carrying for 25 years?*

*What if I didn't have to choose between running my businesses and learning quantum physics?*

*What if there was another way?*

## Finding Claude Code

I tried many AI tools. ChatGPT. Local models. Various coding assistants.

But when I found **Claude Code**, something clicked.

I liked the structure. The way it thought through problems. The way it could help me build something systematic and rigorous—not just answer questions, but actually *create* with me.

I started learning what people call "vibe coding"—a way of working with AI where you describe what you want, iterate on the results, and gradually build something far more complex than you could create alone.

And then, about two weeks ago, I had a crazy idea:

**What if I built an entire PhD curriculum in quantum physics?**

Not a reading list. Not a collection of links. A complete, day-by-day, 6-year curriculum covering graduate-level quantum science and engineering—organized so that someone like me, someone with a full-time job and a family, could actually work through it.

---

## 10 Days That Changed Everything

What happened next still amazes me.

Working with Claude Code—just me and the AI, late nights after the stores closed, early mornings before the day began—I built it.

**2,016 day files.**

**72 months of structured curriculum.**

**Over 10,000 hours of learning, mapped out day by day.**

Every lesson file. Every problem set with worked solutions. Every computational lab in Python. Every connection between classical mathematics and quantum mechanics—explicit and intentional from Day 1.

I referenced curricula from programs at Harvard, MIT, Caltech, and Princeton to ensure comprehensive topic coverage.

**The curriculum covers comparable topics and depth.**

I'm not saying this to brag. I'm saying it because I still can barely believe it myself.

A convenience store owner from Houston, with no formal physics education, working alone with an AI assistant, built a complete graduate-level curriculum in less than two weeks.

This is what becomes possible when human determination meets artificial intelligence.

## The Structure

Here's what the curriculum contains:

| Year | Focus | Days | Hours |
|------|-------|------|-------|
| **Year 0** | Mathematical Foundations | 336 | ~2,500 |
| **Year 1** | Quantum Mechanics Core | 336 | ~2,500 |
| **Year 2** | Advanced Quantum Science | 336 | ~2,500 |
| **Year 3** | Qualifying Exam Preparation | 336 | ~2,500 |
| **Year 4** | Research Phase I | 336 | ~2,500 |
| **Year 5** | Thesis & Defense | 336 | ~2,500 |

Each day is structured for 7 hours of study:

- **Morning (3.5 hours):** Theory and derivations
- **Afternoon (2.5 hours):** Problem solving
- **Evening (1 hour):** Computational labs in Python

You start with calculus. You end with original research.

## Why I Named My Company After My Family

Before I go further, I want to share something personal.

**SIIEA Innovations, LLC** isn't just a company name. It's my family:

- **S** – Shamim (my wife)
- **I** – Imran (me)
- **I** – Imaan (my son)
- **E** – Elahi (my son)
- **A** – Ali (our family name)

Through SIIEA ([siiea.ai](https://siiea.ai)), I invest in AI-powered companies that solve real problems—in transportation, fintech, and service industries.

But here's my philosophy: **I refuse to invest in technology I don't understand.**

Too many people throw money at AI without knowing what a neural network actually does. Too many executives talk about "quantum advantage" without understanding what a qubit is.

I want to be different. I want to understand—deeply, rigorously—the technologies that will shape the next century. Not because someone told me to. Because I believe that understanding creates lasting value.

That's why I built this curriculum. And that's why I'm sharing it with the world.

---

## Why I'm Releasing This Publicly

This question touches something deep in my heart.

When I was young, I couldn't afford to continue my education. University wasn't an option. I had to work, to support my family, to build from nothing.

Now? I could probably afford to go back to school. I have the resources.

But I'm in my 40s. I have businesses to run. A family that depends on me. I can't disappear into a classroom for five years.

And I realized: **I'm not the only one.**

There are millions of people like me. Working professionals who dream of understanding something deeply—quantum physics, machine learning, mathematics—but can't pause their lives to pursue it.

There are students in countries where these resources aren't available. Curious minds who don't know where to start. Self-learners who have the motivation but lack the structure.

**If this curriculum helps even one person—one student, one dreamer, one curious mind somewhere on the other side of the world—then everything I've put into it will be worth it.**

That's not a marketing line. That's the actual reason I'm doing this.

---

## What the AI Revolution Actually Means

Let me be direct about something.

I didn't build this curriculum despite having no formal physics training. I built it *because* I had access to artificial intelligence.

A year ago, this would have been impossible. Even with all the motivation in the world, I couldn't have:

- Researched and synthesized graduate-level physics curricula from multiple universities
- Written 2,016 structured lesson files with correct mathematics
- Created problem sets with worked solutions at PhD level
- Built computational labs in Python for quantum simulation
- Done all of this in 10 days while running my businesses

**AI didn't replace my dream. It made my dream possible.**

This is what I mean when I talk about understanding technology deeply. AI isn't magic. It's a tool—an incredibly powerful tool that amplifies human capability in ways we're only beginning to understand.

The people who learn to work *with* AI—not just use it, but truly collaborate with it—will build things that would have been impossible a few years ago.

I'm living proof of that.

---

## The Resources Already Exist

Here's the irony that drove me to build this:

Everything you need to learn quantum physics at the highest level is already free online.

- **MIT OpenCourseWare** — Complete lecture videos and problem sets
- **IBM Quantum** — Free access to actual quantum computers
- **John Preskill's Caltech lecture notes** — Graduate-level theory
- **Nielsen & Chuang** — The definitive textbook, available at any library

What was missing wasn't the content. It was the **structure**—a coherent path that takes someone from basic calculus to research-level quantum science, organized for self-study.

That's the gap I filled.

---

## How to Use This Curriculum

The curriculum is organized for maximum accessibility.

**If you're starting from scratch:**

```
Year_0_Mathematical_Foundations/
  └── Semester_0A_Calculus_DiffEq/
        └── Month_01_Single_Variable_Calculus/
              └── Week_01_Limits_and_Continuity/
                    └── Day_001_Monday.md  ← START HERE
```

**If you have a math/physics background:**

Take the diagnostic exam in Month 12. Score 80%+ to skip directly to Year 1.

**Tools you'll need:**

```bash
pip install numpy scipy matplotlib sympy jupyter
pip install qiskit qiskit-aer qutip pennylane
```

**The only real requirement:** You have to do the work.

This isn't a shortcut. It's the same rigorous path PhD students walk—just organized for someone who learns on their own time.

## What I've Learned (So Far)

I haven't completed the curriculum yet. I'm at the beginning of my own journey through it. But I've already learned several things:

**1. The math IS the physics.**

Quantum mechanics isn't mysterious once you understand linear algebra and complex analysis. The "weirdness" is just unfamiliarity with the mathematical structures.

**2. Consistency beats intensity.**

I study 5-7 hours on weekends, 1-2 hours on weekdays. A year of steady progress beats a month of burnout.

**3. AI is a collaborator, not a replacement.**

Claude Code didn't learn quantum physics for me. It helped me build the structure within which I'll learn it myself. There's a difference.

**4. It's never too late.**

I'm in my 40s. I started as a clerk. I have no physics degree. And I just built a comprehensive graduate-level curriculum.

If I can do this, what's stopping you?

## A Note on What Matters

Let me end with something honest.

This curriculum won't give me a diploma. No university will stamp a degree based on completing it. When I finish—years from now—I won't have "Dr." in front of my name.

I don't care.

**I want to understand how the universe works.**

That's it. That's the whole reason.

We're living through the most significant technological transition since the invention of classical computing. Quantum computers will break current encryption, simulate molecular interactions for drug discovery, solve optimization problems that defeat classical algorithms.

The people who understand this technology—really understand it, not just the marketing pitch—will shape how it's used.

I want to be one of those people.

And I want anyone with the motivation to have the same opportunity.

---

## The Path Exists

For 25 years, I wanted to understand quantum physics. Life kept getting in the way.

Then AI came along. And I stopped making excuses.

**I couldn't attend a PhD program. So I built my own path.**

Now it's available to anyone who wants it.
