## Success Metrics

By month's end, you should have:

1. **Complete theoretical framework** with no gaps or hand-waving
2. **Fully validated results** with documented verification
3. **Publication-ready figure suite** telling your research story
4. **Comprehensive documentation** enabling full reproducibility

## Notes for Research Execution

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Premature optimization** - Ensure correctness before efficiency
2. **Validation theater** - Tests must actually probe failure modes
3. **Figure fetishism** - Clarity over aesthetics
4. **Documentation debt** - Write as you go, not after
5. **Scope creep** - Stay focused on core contributions

### Signs of Progress

- Mathematical frameworks feel "complete" and "inevitable"
- Validation tests fail in expected ways when deliberately broken
- Story arc becomes clearer, not murkier, as you organize
- Documentation reveals gaps that improve the work
- Excitement about sharing results grows
