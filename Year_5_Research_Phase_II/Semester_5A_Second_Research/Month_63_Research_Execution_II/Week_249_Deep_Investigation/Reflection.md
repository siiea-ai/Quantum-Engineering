## Part V: Honest Self-Assessment

### Intellectual Honesty Check

Answer honestly:

- [ ] All claims are genuinely proven, not just "sketched"
- [ ] I've actively tried to break my own results
- [ ] I've considered alternative explanations
- [ ] I've acknowledged limitations
- [ ] I've given proper credit to related work

### Confidence Calibration

For your main result:

**How confident are you it's correct?** ____%

**How confident are you it's novel?** ____%

**How confident are you it's significant?** ____%

**What would change your confidence?**
>

### Red Flags Check

Have you noticed any of these warning signs?

- [ ] Avoiding checking certain cases
- [ ] Explaining away anomalies without investigation
- [ ] Feeling defensive about questioning
- [ ] Reluctance to share work for feedback
- [ ] Confirmation bias in testing

If any checked, what will you do about it?
