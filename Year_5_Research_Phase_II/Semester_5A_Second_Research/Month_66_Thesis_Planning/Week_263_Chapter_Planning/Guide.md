# Week 263: Chapter Planning

## Days 1835-1841 | Creating Detailed Chapter Outlines

---

## Overview

Week 263 transforms the structural framework from Week 261 and the organized materials from Week 262 into detailed, actionable chapter plans. This week focuses on creating section-level outlines for each thesis chapter, mapping existing content from publications to thesis sections, and identifying gaps that require new writing.

The goal is to produce comprehensive blueprints for each chapter that will guide efficient writing in the coming months. By the end of this week, you will know exactly what needs to be written, what can be adapted from existing work, and how all pieces fit together.
