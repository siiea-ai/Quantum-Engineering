# Month 66: Thesis Planning

## Status: 🔄 NOT STARTED

## Overview

Month 66 marks a critical transition in the PhD journey: the systematic organization and planning of your doctoral thesis. After five years of intensive coursework, research, and publication efforts, this month focuses on synthesizing your accumulated knowledge, research contributions, and scholarly output into a coherent thesis document that will stand as your definitive contribution to the field of quantum science and engineering.

A quantum computing/quantum information PhD thesis typically spans **150-200+ pages** and represents the culmination of years of theoretical development, experimental work, and computational investigation. This month provides the framework for transforming your research papers, notes, code repositories, and experimental data into a unified narrative that demonstrates mastery of the field and original contributions to knowledge.

### Thesis Document Purpose

Your thesis serves multiple critical functions:
1. **Scholarly Record**: Permanent documentation of your research contributions
2. **Defense Preparation**: Foundation for your oral examination
3. **Career Foundation**: Credential for academic and industry positions
4. **Knowledge Transfer**: Guide for future researchers in your area
5. **Personal Achievement**: Synthesis of your doctoral journey

### Recommended Thesis Structure (150-200+ pages)

| Chapter | Page Range | Content Focus |
|---------|------------|---------------|
| **Abstract** | 1-2 | Concise summary of contributions |
| **Introduction** | 15-20 | Motivation, problem statement, thesis overview |
| **Background** | 30-40 | Theoretical foundations, literature review |
| **Research Chapter 1** | 40-60 | First major research contribution |
| **Research Chapter 2** | 40-60 | Second major research contribution |
| **Discussion & Conclusion** | 15-25 | Synthesis, future directions, broader impact |
| **Appendices** | 10-30 | Technical details, code, supplementary data |
| **Bibliography** | 10-20 | Comprehensive references (150-300+ entries) |
