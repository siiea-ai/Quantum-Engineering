## Attending Sessions Strategically

### Session Selection

**Prioritization Framework:**

| Priority | Session Type | Purpose |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| High | Directly related to your research | Learn, identify collaborators |
| High | Potential advisors/employers | Career development |
| Medium | Adjacent fields | Broaden perspective |
| Medium | Emerging areas | Future research directions |
| Lower | Famous speakers on distant topics | General education |

### During Sessions

**Active Engagement:**
1. Sit where you can see clearly (and be seen if you want to meet the speaker)
2. Take structured notes (see Notes Template)
3. Formulate questions during talk
4. Identify connections to your work
5. Note potential collaborators or references

**Asking Questions:**

When to ask:
- If genuinely curious about a clarification
- If your question might benefit others
- If you want to connect with the speaker

How to ask:
- Raise hand clearly during Q&A
- State question concisely (15-30 seconds max)
- Avoid multi-part questions
- Don't use questions to show off

**Post-Session Actions:**
- Approach speaker if you have follow-up questions
- Introduce yourself briefly
- Note insights in your conference notes
- Flag papers to read later

### Managing Session Fatigue

**Reality Check:**
Attending 6-8 hours of talks daily is exhausting. Plan for sustainability:

- **Schedule breaks**: Don't attend every session back-to-back
- **Strategic skipping**: It's okay to miss sessions
- **Networking vs. sessions**: Sometimes hallway conversations are more valuable
- **Physical needs**: Stay hydrated, eat well, move around

## Delivering Your Presentation

### The Day of Your Talk

**Timeline:**

| When | Action |
|------|--------|
| Morning | Review first slides, visualize success |
| 60 min before | Arrive at venue |
| 30 min before | Find session room |
| 15 min before | Check in with session chair |
| 10 min before | Test equipment |
| 5 min before | Settle, breathe, focus |
| Presentation | Deliver with confidence |
| After | Answer questions, thank chair |

### Before You Speak

**Technical Setup:**
- Introduce yourself to session chair
- Connect laptop (or verify file on conference computer)
- Test that slides display correctly
- Confirm clicker/pointer works
- Adjust microphone if available

**Mental Preparation:**
- Deep breathing (4-7-8 technique)
- Positive visualization
- Focus on your message, not yourself
- Remember: you know this material better than anyone

### During Your Talk

**Opening Strong:**
- Make eye contact with audience
- Speak first sentence from memory
- Establish presence before advancing slides
- Smile genuinely if it's natural

**Maintaining Engagement:**
- Scan the room regularly
- Speak to people, not screen
- Use natural pauses for emphasis
- Vary pace and tone
- Check timing at key checkpoints

**Managing Problems:**

If technology fails:
- Stay calm
- Ask session chair for help
- Have PDF backup ready
- If necessary, continue without slides briefly

If you lose your place:
- Pause (audiences don't notice brief pauses)
- Glance at current slide
- Summarize: "So to recap..."
- Continue forward

If time is running short:
- Skip planned slides as per contingency plan
- Protect main result and summary
- Don't rush—speak normally

### Handling Q&A

**During Questions:**
1. Listen completely (don't formulate answer while they speak)
2. Repeat/rephrase if needed ("So you're asking about...")
3. Pause briefly to organize thoughts
4. Answer directly, then elaborate if needed
5. Be honest about limitations

**Difficult Situations:**

Hostile question:
- Stay calm and professional
- Acknowledge their point
- Respond factually
- Offer to discuss further afterward

Unknown answer:
- "That's a great question. I haven't explored that, but my intuition is..."
- "I'd need to think more carefully about that case."
- "Let's connect after the session."

Long/rambling question:
- "Let me address the core question..."
- "That's a rich area—we can discuss more afterward."

## Networking at Conferences

### Why Conference Networking Matters

Academic careers are built on relationships:
- Collaborations often start with conference conversations
- Job opportunities emerge through networks
- Letters of recommendation come from people who know your work
- Feedback improves research

### Overcoming Networking Discomfort

**Common Barriers:**
- Introversion
- Imposter syndrome
- Not knowing what to say
- Fear of rejection

**Reframing Networking:**
- It's about shared interests, not self-promotion
- Most researchers are happy to discuss their work
- Everyone at a conference is open to meeting others
- Quality > quantity—deep conversations matter more than many contacts

### Strategies for Effective Networking

**Initiating Conversations:**

After a talk:
"Hi, I really enjoyed your talk. I'm [Name] from [Institution]. I had a question about [specific point]..."

At a poster session:
"Could you walk me through your work? I'm interested in [aspect]..."

At coffee/lunch:
"Mind if I join you? I'm [Name]. What area do you work in?"

With famous researchers:
Be respectful of their time but don't be intimidated. Ask a specific, intelligent question about their recent work.

**Conversation Techniques:**

Ask about their work:
- "What are you working on now?"
- "What got you interested in [topic]?"
- "What are the main open questions in your area?"

Find common ground:
- Research overlaps
- Shared advisors/collaborators
- Institutional connections
- Common challenges

Share your work concisely:
- Have a 30-second description ready
- Expand if they're interested
- Don't monopolize the conversation

Close with connection:
- "I'd love to continue this conversation. Could we exchange contact info?"
- "I'll send you that paper we discussed."
- "It was great meeting you."

### Networking Venues

**High-Value Opportunities:**
| Venue | Opportunity |
|-------|-------------|
| Coffee breaks | Informal conversations |
| Poster sessions | Extended discussions |
| Conference dinners | Relaxed relationship building |
| Receptions | Meet across subfields |
| Session Q&A | Follow up with speakers |

**Low-Pressure Opportunities:**
| Venue | Approach |
|-------|----------|
| Standing in line | Start casual conversation |
| Sitting next to someone | "What brings you to this session?" |
| Shared meals | Join tables with unfamiliar faces |

### Networking for Different Goals

**Finding Collaborators:**
- Identify researchers with complementary skills
- Discuss specific research overlaps
