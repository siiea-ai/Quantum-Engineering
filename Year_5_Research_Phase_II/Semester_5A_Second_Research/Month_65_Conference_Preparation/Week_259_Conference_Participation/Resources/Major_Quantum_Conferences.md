## Virtual Conference Considerations

Many conferences now have hybrid or virtual options.

**Advantages:**
- Lower cost
- No travel time
- Can attend multiple conferences
- Recordings often available

**Disadvantages:**
- Harder to network
- Zoom fatigue
- Time zone challenges
- Reduced engagement

**Strategy:**
Prioritize in-person attendance for conferences where networking is crucial (job searching, finding collaborators), and use virtual for staying current on the field.
