ANTICIPATED CONCERN: Threshold estimation uncertainty

Reviewer might say:
"The error bars on the threshold estimate are large.
How confident are you in the claimed value?"

Our response strategy:
- Acknowledge: Yes, uncertainty is significant (±0.05%)
- Explain: Uncertainty is dominated by systematic
  calibration error, which we've characterized
- Address: We can add bootstrap analysis to strengthen
  error estimation
- Strengthen: We have additional data at intermediate
  error rates that we can include

Supporting materials available:
- [x] Bootstrap analysis code

- Stop working on your research
- Neglect other responsibilities

### Managing Expectations

**Timeline Expectations**:
- High-impact journals: 4-8 weeks to initial decision
- Specialized journals: 4-12 weeks
- Faster if expedited review requested

**Decision Probabilities** (rough estimates):
- Top journals (Nature, PRX): ~20-30% acceptance
- High-impact specialized (PRL, npj QI): ~30-40%
- Standard journals (PRA): ~50-60%

### Handling Different Outcomes

**If accepted**: Prepare camera-ready version promptly

**If minor revisions**: Quick turnaround (2 weeks)

**If major revisions**: Thorough response, maintain quality

**If rejected**: Learn from reviews, resubmit appropriately
