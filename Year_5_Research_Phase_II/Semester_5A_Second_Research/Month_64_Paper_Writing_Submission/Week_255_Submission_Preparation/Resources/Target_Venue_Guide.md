## Journal Selection Decision Tree

```
Is this a major breakthrough with broad science impact?
├── Yes → Consider Nature/Science
│   └── Rejected? → Try Nature Physics
└── No → Continue below

Is this of broad interest within physics?
├── Yes → Consider PRL (if 4 pages) or PRX Quantum (if longer)
└── No → Continue below

Is this quantum-specific but significant?
├── Yes → Consider npj QI or Quantum
└── No → Continue below

Is this solid technical work needing full details?
├── Yes → Consider PRA or PRResearch
└── No → Re-evaluate scope
```

## Submission Timing Considerations

### When to Submit Where

**PRX Quantum / npj QI**:
- Main results complete
- Theoretical framework solid
- No immediate scooping risk

**PRL** (consider earlier submission if):
- Result is time-sensitive
- Competition is active
- 4 pages captures the essence

**arXiv First**:
- Establish priority
- Get community feedback
- Timing for funding deadlines

### Coordinating arXiv and Journal Submission

**Option 1: arXiv First**
1. Post to arXiv
2. Submit to journal (same day or shortly after)
3. Mention arXiv ID in cover letter

**Option 2: Journal First**
1. Submit to journal
2. Wait for acceptance/rejection
3. Post to arXiv upon acceptance

**Option 3: Simultaneous**
1. Submit to journal
2. Post to arXiv (may delay for journal review)
3. Update arXiv with journal reference upon publication

**Most Common in Quantum**: Option 1 (arXiv first)

## Rejection and Resubmission Strategy

### If Desk Rejected

- Move to next tier quickly
- Minimal revision (unless obvious issue)
- Don't take personally (~50%+ desk rejection at top journals)

### If Rejected After Review

1. Read reviews carefully
2. Address substantive criticisms
3. Consider if original venue was appropriate
4. Resubmit to different journal (cite reviews if helpful)

### Appeal (Rarely Successful)

Only appeal if:
- Clear factual error by reviewers
- Reviewer conflict of interest
- Procedural issues

---

## Journal Metrics Beyond Impact Factor

### Article-Level Metrics
- Altmetric score (social/news attention)
- Citation count
- Download statistics

### Alternative Metrics to Consider
- Review quality (constructive feedback)
- Review speed
- Editorial professionalism
- Community reputation
- Open access availability

---

*Journal selection should match paper scope and ambition. Aim appropriately—neither too high (wasting time) nor too low (selling work short).*
