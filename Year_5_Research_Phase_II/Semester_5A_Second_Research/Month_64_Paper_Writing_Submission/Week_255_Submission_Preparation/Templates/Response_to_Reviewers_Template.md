## Response Strategies by Comment Type

### Type 1: Requests for Clarification

**Reviewer says**: "The authors should clarify how they measured X."

**Response template**:
```
We thank the reviewer for pointing out this ambiguity. We have
clarified the measurement procedure for X in the Methods section.
Specifically, we now explain that [brief explanation].

Changes made (Section II, paragraph 2, lines XX-XX):
"[Quote the new text that addresses this]"
```

### Type 2: Requests for Additional Data/Analysis

**Reviewer says**: "The authors should show the dependence on parameter Y."

**Response template** (if you have the data):
```
We agree that showing the dependence on Y strengthens the paper.
We have added this analysis and present the results in new Figure S3
and in the main text.

As shown in Figure S3, the [quantity] scales as [relationship] with Y,
confirming [expected behavior / our model].

Changes made (Section III, paragraph 4, lines XX-XX):
"[Quote added text]"

New Supplementary Figure S3 added: "[Caption of new figure]"
```

**Response template** (if you cannot provide the data):
```
We appreciate this suggestion. Unfortunately, [reason why data is
not available: e.g., measurement would require new fabrication run /
is beyond the scope of current experimental setup].

However, we have addressed this concern by [alternative approach:
e.g., citing literature that shows this dependence / providing
theoretical argument / noting this as future work].

Changes made: [Specify changes or explain why no change needed]
```

### Type 3: Disagreement with Interpretation

**Reviewer says**: "The interpretation in terms of X is not supported by the data."

**Response template** (if you agree):
```
The reviewer raises an excellent point. We have reconsidered our
interpretation and agree that the data more strongly supports
[alternative interpretation]. We have revised the Discussion
accordingly.

Changes made (Section V, paragraph 3, lines XX-XX):
"[Quote revised interpretation]"
```

**Response template** (if you disagree):
```
We respectfully disagree with this interpretation for the following
reasons:

1. [First evidence/argument supporting your interpretation]
2. [Second evidence/argument]
3. [Third evidence/argument]

Furthermore, the alternative interpretation [X] would predict
[Y], which is inconsistent with our observation of [Z] (Figure 3b).

Nevertheless, we acknowledge that other interpretations are possible
and have added a note to this effect in the Discussion.

Changes made (Section V, paragraph 4, lines XX-XX):
"We note that alternative interpretations, such as [X], cannot be
completely ruled out. However, our data are most consistent with
[our interpretation] because [reason]."
```

### Type 4: Requests for Literature Citation

**Reviewer says**: "The authors should cite the work of Smith et al."

**Response template**:
```
We thank the reviewer for bringing this reference to our attention.
We have added the citation and discuss its relevance in the
Introduction.

Changes made (Section I, paragraph 3, lines XX-XX):
"Prior work by Smith et al. [new ref] demonstrated [finding],
which [relationship to our work]."

Reference added: [Full citation]
```

### Type 5: Technical Errors or Typos

**Reviewer says**: "There is an error in Eq. (5)."

**Response template**:
```
We thank the reviewer for catching this error. The correct expression
is [correct equation]. This was a typographical error and does not
affect any of the results or conclusions, which were computed using
the correct expression.

Changes made (Equation 5):
Before: [old equation]
After: [corrected equation]
```

### Type 6: Requests for Improved Figures

**Reviewer says**: "Figure 2 is difficult to read."

**Response template**:
```
We have redesigned Figure 2 to improve clarity. Specifically, we have:
- Increased the font size of axis labels
- Changed to a colorblind-accessible color scheme
- Added a legend explaining all symbols
- Improved resolution to 300 DPI

Please see the revised Figure 2.
```

### Type 7: Scope or Significance Questions

**Reviewer says**: "The significance of this work is unclear."

**Response template**:
```
We appreciate this feedback and have strengthened our discussion of
the work's significance. The key contributions are:

1. [Specific contribution 1 with quantitative impact if possible]
2. [Specific contribution 2]
3. [Specific contribution 3]

We have revised the Introduction and Discussion to emphasize these
points more clearly.

Changes made (Introduction, paragraph 4, lines XX-XX):
"[Quote emphasizing significance]"

Changes made (Discussion, paragraph 1, lines XX-XX):
"[Quote on implications]"
```

### Type 8: Requests for Comparison to Other Work

**Reviewer says**: "The authors should compare to the method of Jones et al."

**Response template**:
```
We have added a comparison to Jones et al. [ref]. As shown in
Table 1 (new), our method achieves [X% improvement in Y metric]
compared to their approach, while using [fewer resources / simpler
implementation / etc.].

Changes made (Section IV, new paragraph, lines XX-XX):
"[Quote of comparison discussion]"

New Table 1 added: "[Caption of comparison table]"
```
