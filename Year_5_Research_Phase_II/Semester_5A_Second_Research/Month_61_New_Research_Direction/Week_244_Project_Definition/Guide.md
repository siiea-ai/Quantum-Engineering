# Week 244: Project Definition

## A Comprehensive Guide to Writing a Detailed Research Proposal

**Days 1702-1708 | Month 61, Week 4**

---

## Introduction

Week 244 culminates Month 61's systematic process of direction selection with the creation of a comprehensive research proposal. This proposal document (3000+ words) serves as the definitive blueprint for your second major research project, guiding your Year 5-6 work and forming the nucleus of your thesis.

### The Purpose of the Research Proposal

A well-crafted research proposal accomplishes multiple objectives:

1. **Articulates Vision:** Clearly communicates what you intend to accomplish
2. **Demonstrates Feasibility:** Shows the project is achievable with available resources
3. **Establishes Significance:** Argues why the work matters to the field
4. **Provides Roadmap:** Creates a concrete plan for execution
5. **Enables Feedback:** Allows advisor and committee to provide guidance
6. **Commits Resources:** Justifies allocation of time and resources
7. **Documents Thinking:** Captures your reasoning for future reference
8. **Positions Career:** Articulates your research identity and trajectory

### The Proposal as a Living Document

While this week produces a complete proposal draft, understand that:
- The proposal will evolve as research progresses
- Plans will be refined based on early results
- Flexibility is built into the timeline and milestones
- The document serves as a starting point, not a rigid contract

## Section-by-Section Writing Guide

### Section 1: Executive Summary (200-300 words)

The executive summary provides a self-contained overview of the entire proposal. Write this section last, after completing all other sections.

**What to Include:**
- The problem or question being addressed (1-2 sentences)
- Why it matters (1-2 sentences)
- Your proposed approach (2-3 sentences)
- Expected contributions (2-3 sentences)
- Timeline summary (1 sentence)

**Writing Tips:**
- Make it accessible to readers outside your specialty
- Avoid jargon; use clear, direct language
- Each sentence should earn its place
- This is what busy committee members may read first (and possibly only)

**Template:**
```
[This research addresses X, a significant challenge in Y field.]
[This matters because Z, with implications for W.]
[The proposed approach involves A and B, building on C.]
[If successful, this work will contribute D and E to the field.]
[The project is structured as a F-month investigation with milestones at G.]
```

## Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them

### Pitfall 1: Scope Creep
**Problem:** Proposing too much for the timeline
**Solution:** Focus ruthlessly; cut nice-to-have elements

### Pitfall 2: Vague Methodology
**Problem:** Methodology too general to assess feasibility
**Solution:** Add specific details while maintaining flexibility

### Pitfall 3: Missing Significance
**Problem:** Not clearly arguing why this matters
**Solution:** Explicitly connect to field-wide challenges

### Pitfall 4: Unrealistic Timeline
**Problem:** Timeline assumes everything goes perfectly
**Solution:** Add 20-30% buffer; include contingency

### Pitfall 5: Ignoring Alternatives
**Problem:** Not acknowledging other approaches
**Solution:** Briefly discuss alternatives and justify your choice

### Pitfall 6: Over-promising
**Problem:** Claiming more than you can deliver
**Solution:** Be ambitious but honest; distinguish minimum from stretch

### Pitfall 7: Disconnected Sections
**Problem:** Sections feel like separate documents
**Solution:** Add transitions; reference earlier points; maintain consistent voice
