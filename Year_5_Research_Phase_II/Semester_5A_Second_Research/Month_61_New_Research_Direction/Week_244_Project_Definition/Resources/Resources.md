# Week 244 Resources: Project Definition and Proposal Writing

## Proposal Writing Resources

### Structure and Organization

#### Research Proposal Components

A well-structured research proposal follows this logical flow:

```
WHAT and WHY (Motivation)
    → What problem exists?
    → Why does it matter?
    → What gap will you address?

WHAT OTHERS HAVE DONE (Literature)
    → What is currently known?
    → What approaches have been tried?
    → What remains unresolved?

WHAT YOU WILL DO (Research Plan)
    → What questions will you answer?
    → How will you answer them?
    → What will you produce?

WHEN and HOW (Execution)
    → What is your timeline?
    → What are the milestones?
    → What are the risks?

WHAT SUCCESS LOOKS LIKE (Outcomes)
    → What will you contribute?
    → How will you know you succeeded?
```

### Writing Style Guidance

#### Academic Writing Principles

**Clarity:**
- Use precise language
- Define technical terms
- Prefer simple words over complex ones
- One idea per sentence

**Conciseness:**
- Eliminate unnecessary words
- Avoid redundancy
- Every sentence should earn its place
- Target word counts force discipline

**Coherence:**
- Logical flow between sentences
- Clear transitions between paragraphs
- Each section builds on previous
- Consistent terminology throughout

**Confidence:**
- Assert claims directly
- Avoid hedging unnecessarily
- Support claims with evidence
- Own your expertise

---

#### Common Phrases to Avoid

| Avoid | Better Alternative |
|-------|-------------------|
| "It is important to note that..." | [Just state it directly] |
| "In order to" | "To" |
| "Due to the fact that" | "Because" |
| "At this point in time" | "Now" or "Currently" |
| "It has been shown that" | "[Authors] showed that" |
| "A number of" | [Specific number] or "Several" |
| "Utilize" | "Use" |
| "Methodology" | "Method" (usually) |
| "Prior to" | "Before" |
| "In the event that" | "If" |

---

#### Active vs. Passive Voice

**Prefer Active Voice:**
- Active: "I will measure coherence times."
- Passive: "Coherence times will be measured."

**When Passive is Acceptable:**
- Standard methodology descriptions
- When actor is obvious or unimportant
- To emphasize results over researcher

---

### Proposal Argumentation

#### The Persuasive Proposal

Your proposal makes an argument:

**Claim:** This research is worth doing.

**Supporting Arguments:**
1. The problem is significant
2. The gap is real and important
3. The approach is appropriate
4. The researcher is capable
5. The resources are available
6. The timeline is realistic

**Evidence Types:**
- Literature citations
- Prior work/preliminary results
- Methodological precedent
- Resource availability statements
- Timeline feasibility analysis

---

#### Addressing Objections

Anticipate and preemptively address objections:

| Potential Objection | Preemptive Response |
|--------------------|---------------------|
| "Too ambitious" | Scope is realistic; minimum success defined |
| "Already done" | Gap analysis shows what's new |
| "Too risky" | Risk assessment with mitigation |
| "Lacks expertise" | Background and skill development plan |
| "Resources unavailable" | Resource availability confirmed |

---

## Sample Proposals and Examples

### NSF and NIH Proposal Structure (for reference)

While your PhD proposal is internal, understanding grant proposal structure is valuable:

**NSF Format:**
- Project Summary (1 page)
- Project Description (15 pages)
- References
- Biographical Sketches
- Budget and Justification

**Key Elements to Borrow:**
- Intellectual Merit (significance)
- Broader Impacts (applications)
- Clear research plan
- Explicit timeline
- Risk assessment

---

### Sample Executive Summary Structure

```
[Opening hook - the big challenge] [1 sentence]

[The specific gap you address] [1-2 sentences]

[Your approach and why it will work] [2-3 sentences]

[Expected contributions and significance] [2-3 sentences]

[Timeline summary] [1 sentence]
```

---

### Sample Methodology Paragraph

```
To address [sub-question X], I will employ [method].
This approach is appropriate because [justification].
Specifically, I will [specific steps].
The expected output is [deliverable], which will be validated by [validation approach].
This builds on [prior work/established technique], adapted to [your context].
```

---

## Timeline and Project Planning

### Gantt Chart Construction

A Gantt chart visualizes your project timeline:

**Elements:**
- Phases as major rows
- Tasks as sub-rows
- Time as horizontal axis
- Bars showing duration
- Diamonds for milestones
- Arrows for dependencies

**Tools:**
- Microsoft Project
- TeamGantt
- Mermaid (for markdown)
- Excel/Google Sheets
- Lucidchart/draw.io

---

### Realistic Timeline Estimation

**Estimating Task Duration:**

1. **Base estimate:** How long if everything goes well?
2. **Realistic estimate:** Base × 1.5-2.0
3. **Pessimistic estimate:** Base × 3.0

**Use PERT formula:** (Optimistic + 4×Likely + Pessimistic) / 6

**Add Buffer:**
- 10-15% per phase for minor issues
- Explicit "catch-up" periods between phases
- No tasks scheduled at 100% capacity

---

### Milestone Definition

**Good Milestones Are:**
- Specific and measurable
- Binary (complete or not)
- Meaningful (represent real progress)
- Time-bound (have target dates)
- Verifiable (can demonstrate completion)

**Examples:**

| Poor Milestone | Good Milestone |
|----------------|----------------|
| "Make progress on simulations" | "Complete simulation of X showing Y" |
| "Read more papers" | "Literature review document complete" |
| "Work on analysis" | "Analysis of dataset complete with results" |
| "Start writing" | "First draft of Paper 1 complete" |

---

## Risk Assessment Framework

### Risk Identification

**Categories of Risk:**

1. **Technical Risks:**
   - Method doesn't work as expected
   - Results are inconclusive
   - Required accuracy not achievable
   - Computation is intractable

2. **Resource Risks:**
   - Equipment unavailable or fails
   - Collaborator unavailable
   - Funding insufficient
   - Computing resources inadequate

3. **Timeline Risks:**
   - Tasks take longer than expected
   - Dependencies create bottlenecks
   - External factors cause delays
   - Scope creep

4. **External Risks:**
   - Competition publishes similar work
   - Field shifts away from direction
   - Key personnel leave
   - Regulatory/ethical issues

---

### Risk Assessment Matrix

| Probability \ Impact | Low | Medium | High |
|---------------------|-----|--------|------|
| **High** | Monitor | Mitigate | Avoid/Transfer |
| **Medium** | Accept | Mitigate | Mitigate |
| **Low** | Accept | Accept | Monitor |

---

### Mitigation Strategies

| Strategy | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| **Avoid** | Change plan to eliminate risk | Use proven method instead of novel one |
| **Mitigate** | Reduce probability or impact | Parallel approaches, earlier testing |
| **Transfer** | Shift risk to another party | Collaborate with expert, outsource |
| **Accept** | Acknowledge and plan for occurrence | Build buffer into timeline |

---
