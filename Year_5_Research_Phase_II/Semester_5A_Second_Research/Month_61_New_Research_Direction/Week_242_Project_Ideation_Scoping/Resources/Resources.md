# Week 242 Resources: Project Ideation and Scoping

## Ideation and Creativity Resources

### Creative Thinking Frameworks

#### SCAMPER Technique
A structured approach to generating new ideas by transforming existing ones:
- **S**ubstitute: What could you substitute in existing approaches?
- **C**ombine: What ideas could you combine?
- **A**dapt: What could you adapt from other fields?
- **M**odify: What could you modify, magnify, or minimize?
- **P**ut to other uses: How could existing techniques be repurposed?
- **E**liminate: What could you remove to simplify?
- **R**everse/Rearrange: What if you reversed assumptions or order?

#### First Principles Thinking
Break problems down to fundamental truths and build up from there:
1. Identify assumptions underlying current approaches
2. Question each assumption's validity
3. Build new understanding from proven foundations
4. Generate solutions unbiased by convention

#### Analogical Reasoning
Draw insights from similar problems in different domains:
1. Identify the core structure of your problem
2. Find analogous problems in other fields
3. Analyze how analogous problems were solved
4. Adapt solutions to your context

### Research Direction Evaluation Criteria

#### The "RICE" Framework (adapted for research)
- **Reach:** How many people/systems would this impact?
- **Impact:** How significant would the contribution be?
- **Confidence:** How certain are you of success?
- **Effort:** How much work is required?

**Score = (Reach × Impact × Confidence) / Effort**

#### The "T-shaped" Project Criterion
Good PhD projects should be:
- Deep in one specific area (the vertical bar)
- Connected to broader themes (the horizontal bar)

Evaluate whether your direction achieves both.

#### The "Publication Test"
Ask: "What would the paper title and abstract look like?"
If you can write a compelling abstract, the direction may be promising.

#### The "Morning Test"
Imagine working on this project for the next 2-3 years.
Would you be excited to start work most mornings?

## Decision-Making Frameworks

### Weighted Scoring Models

#### Basic Weighted Score
For each criterion:
1. Assign importance weight (0-1, sum to 1)
2. Score each option (1-5)
3. Calculate weighted scores
4. Compare totals

#### Pairwise Comparison
When weights are unclear:
1. List all criteria
2. Compare each pair: "Is A more important than B?"
3. Count wins for each criterion
4. Convert to weights

### Decision Matrices

#### The Eisenhower Matrix (adapted)
Categorize directions by:
- Important + Urgent (do first)
- Important + Not Urgent (schedule deliberately)
- Not Important + Urgent (question necessity)
- Not Important + Not Urgent (eliminate)

For research: "Important" = scientific significance, "Urgent" = competitive pressure

#### Risk-Reward Matrix
Plot directions on 2D grid:
- X-axis: Risk level (low to high)
- Y-axis: Potential reward (low to high)

Seek directions in high-reward regions with acceptable risk.

## Advisor Consultation Resources

### Preparing for Advisor Meetings

#### Pre-Meeting Checklist
- [ ] Summarize Week 241 findings (1 page)
- [ ] List top 3-5 candidate directions (1 paragraph each)
- [ ] Prepare specific questions (5-10)
- [ ] Identify decision points needing input
- [ ] Prepare visual aids if helpful

#### Effective Question Types

**Open questions:**
- "What do you see as the most promising direction and why?"
- "What am I missing in my analysis?"
- "What would you need to see to support direction X?"

**Specific questions:**
- "Is collaborator Y accessible for this project?"
- "Do we have the equipment capability for measurement Z?"
- "What's your timeline expectation for this phase?"

**Strategic questions:**
- "How does direction X position me for job market Y?"
- "What differentiates our potential contribution?"
- "Where do you see the field heading?"

### Managing Disagreements

When your preferences differ from advisor's:

1. **Understand their reasoning:** Ask clarifying questions
2. **Present your case:** Use evidence and structured arguments
3. **Find common ground:** Identify shared priorities
4. **Propose compromises:** Hybrid approaches or staged decisions
5. **Accept guidance:** Advisors have valuable pattern recognition
