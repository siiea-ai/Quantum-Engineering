# Week 242: Project Ideation and Scoping

## A Comprehensive Guide to Generating and Evaluating Research Directions

**Days 1688-1694 | Month 61, Week 2**

---

## Introduction

Week 242 transforms the landscape insights from Week 241 into concrete research direction candidates. This week focuses on structured ideation, rigorous evaluation, and strategic narrowing to identify the most promising second project directions for your PhD.

The transition from landscape awareness to project definition requires a fundamentally creative act: identifying the specific contribution you will make. This guide provides frameworks that balance divergent thinking (generating many possibilities) with convergent analysis (evaluating and selecting the best options).

### The Ideation Challenge

Generating a compelling second research project requires navigating several tensions:

| Tension | Balancing Point |
|---------|-----------------|
| Ambition vs. Feasibility | Ambitious enough to matter, feasible within PhD constraints |
| Novelty vs. Foundation | Novel enough to contribute, grounded enough to execute |
| Personal Interest vs. Field Importance | Personally motivating, externally significant |
| Independence vs. Collaboration | Demonstrates independence, leverages collaboration |
| Specialization vs. Breadth | Deep expertise, while building versatility |

This week's structured approach helps you navigate these tensions systematically.

## The Ideation and Scoping Framework

### Phase 1: Divergent Ideation (Days 1688-1689)

The first phase prioritizes quantity over quality, generating as many potential research directions as possible.

#### 1.1 Idea Generation Techniques

**Technique 1: Gap-Based Ideation**

Starting from the gaps identified in Week 241:
- For each gap, generate 2-3 specific research questions
- Consider theoretical, experimental, and computational approaches to each gap
- Combine gaps that might be addressed together
- Fragment large gaps into PhD-sized pieces

**Technique 2: Skill-Based Ideation**

Starting from your unique skills and expertise:
- List your 10 strongest technical skills from Year 4
- For each skill, ask: "What unsolved problem could this skill help address?"
- Consider novel applications of familiar techniques
- Identify problems where your skill combination is unique

**Technique 3: Connection-Based Ideation**

Starting from interdisciplinary connections:
- List 3-5 fields adjacent to your primary area
- For each field, identify recent breakthroughs or techniques
- Ask: "How might this apply to quantum engineering challenges?"
- Consider problems that require bridging disciplines

**Technique 4: Contrarian Ideation**

Starting from abandoned or overlooked directions:
- Identify approaches the field has moved away from
- Ask: "Has anything changed that might make this viable now?"
- Consider minority viewpoints in ongoing debates
- Explore simplifications of complex approaches

**Technique 5: Future-Back Ideation**

Starting from imagined future states:
- Envision the field in 10-20 years
- Identify milestones on the path to that future
- Ask: "What research now would enable that future?"
- Consider enabling technologies and foundational understanding

**Technique 6: Problem-Driven Ideation**

Starting from real-world applications:
- List 10 problems quantum technology might address
- For each, identify the key technical barriers
- Ask: "What research would help overcome these barriers?"
- Consider near-term vs. long-term application horizons

#### 1.2 Structured Brainstorming Session

**Session Structure (2-3 hours):**

1. **Warm-up (15 min):** Review Week 241 landscape analysis
2. **Rapid generation (30 min):** Use each technique above, 5 min per technique
3. **Free association (20 min):** Build on generated ideas freely
4. **Combination (15 min):** Look for synergies between ideas
5. **Wild ideas (10 min):** Generate deliberately ambitious/risky ideas
6. **Documentation (30 min):** Record all ideas with brief descriptions

**Target:** Generate 15-25 distinct research direction ideas

#### 1.3 Idea Documentation Format

For each idea generated, capture:

```markdown
## Idea [Number]: [Brief Title]

**One-sentence description:**
[What is the core research question or goal?]

**Origin:**
[Which ideation technique generated this?]

**Initial feasibility sense:**
[ ] Clearly feasible
[ ] Probably feasible
[ ] Uncertain
[ ] Likely infeasible
[ ] Wild idea (stretch goal)

**Connection to Year 4 work:**
[Brief description of connection, if any]

**Notes:**
[Any additional thoughts]
```

---

### Phase 2: Initial Screening (Day 1690)

With many ideas generated, Phase 2 quickly filters to a manageable set for deeper evaluation.

#### 2.1 Quick Viability Screen

Apply these binary criteria to eliminate clearly unsuitable ideas:

| Criterion | Question | Pass/Fail |
|-----------|----------|-----------|
| Time constraint | Could meaningful progress be made in 18-24 months? | |
| Resource availability | Are required resources accessible? | |
| Skill proximity | Are required skills learnable in reasonable time? | |
| Advisor alignment | Would advisor support this direction? | |
| Career relevance | Does this advance your career goals? | |
| Distinctiveness | Is this sufficiently different from Year 4 work? | |

Ideas failing 2+ criteria are deprioritized (but not discarded - keep for reference).

#### 2.2 Interest and Excitement Filter

Among viable ideas, apply personal engagement criteria:

- **Intellectual excitement:** Does this problem genuinely fascinate you?
- **Sustained interest:** Would you still want to work on this in 2 years?
- **Pride potential:** Would you be proud to present this at conferences?
- **Morning test:** Would you be excited to start working on this each morning?

Rank remaining ideas by personal engagement (High/Medium/Low).

#### 2.3 Narrowing Target

After Phase 2 screening, aim to have:
- 8-12 ideas that pass viability screening
- 5-8 ideas with high personal engagement
- All ideas documented for potential future revisiting

## Connection to Your Thesis

The ideation and scoping work this week directly shapes your thesis in multiple ways:

### Thesis Structure Implications

Your second project will likely constitute 2-3 thesis chapters. Consider:
- How does this complement Year 4 work?
- What narrative connects your projects?
- What unified contribution emerges?

### Research Identity Formation

Your second project solidifies your research identity:
- What will you be known for?
- What expertise will you claim?
- How do your projects together define your niche?

### Committee Considerations

Your thesis committee will evaluate your project choice:
- Does it demonstrate intellectual independence?
- Is it appropriately ambitious for a PhD?
- Does it show strategic thinking about the field?

## Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them

### Pitfall 1: Premature Convergence
**Problem:** Settling on one idea too quickly without exploring alternatives.
**Solution:** Force yourself to generate minimum 15 ideas before evaluating any deeply.

### Pitfall 2: Analysis Paralysis
**Problem:** Over-analyzing to the point of inability to decide.
**Solution:** Set firm deadlines for each phase; accept that perfect information is impossible.

### Pitfall 3: Ignoring Personal Fit
**Problem:** Choosing based purely on external criteria, ignoring motivation.
**Solution:** Weight personal interest significantly; you'll work on this for years.

### Pitfall 4: Feasibility Blindness
**Problem:** Falling in love with an idea without honestly assessing feasibility.
**Solution:** Explicitly play devil's advocate for each top candidate.

### Pitfall 5: Fear of Ambition
**Problem:** Choosing safe, incremental projects to avoid risk.
**Solution:** Remember that the second project should be more ambitious than the first.

### Pitfall 6: Ignoring Advisor Input
**Problem:** Dismissing advisor concerns without serious consideration.
**Solution:** Advisors have valuable pattern recognition; take concerns seriously.

### Pitfall 7: Overweighting Competition
**Problem:** Avoiding all areas with any competition.
**Solution:** Some competition validates importance; focus on differentiation, not avoidance.
