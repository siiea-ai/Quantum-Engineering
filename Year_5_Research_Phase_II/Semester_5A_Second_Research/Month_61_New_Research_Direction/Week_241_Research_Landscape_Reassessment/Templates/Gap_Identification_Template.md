## Gap Category Definitions

### Type A: Theoretical Gaps
Gaps in fundamental understanding, mathematical frameworks, or predictive models.

**Examples:**
- Missing proof for conjectured scaling behavior
- Unexplained experimental observations
- Incomplete theory for intermediate regimes
- Unresolved contradictions between models

### Type B: Experimental Gaps
Gaps between what theory predicts and what has been demonstrated.

**Examples:**
- Unobserved predicted phenomena
- Precision limits below theoretical bounds
- Scaling demonstrations not yet achieved
- Control capabilities not yet demonstrated

### Type C: Methodological Gaps
Missing tools, techniques, or approaches needed for progress.

**Examples:**
- Absent characterization methods
- Inadequate simulation techniques
- Missing benchmarking frameworks
- Lacking error analysis tools

### Type D: Application Gaps
Opportunities to apply quantum techniques to unsolved problems.

**Examples:**
- Unexplored use cases for existing capabilities
- Translation barriers from lab to application
- Integration challenges with classical systems
- Domain-specific optimization opportunities
