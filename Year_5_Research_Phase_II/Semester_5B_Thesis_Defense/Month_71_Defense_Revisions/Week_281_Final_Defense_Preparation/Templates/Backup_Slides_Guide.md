# Backup Slides Guide

## Purpose

Backup slides serve as your preparation arsenal for the Q&A portion of your thesis defense. They demonstrate thorough preparation, allow detailed responses without disrupting presentation flow, and provide visual support for complex explanations. A well-prepared backup slide deck typically contains 20-40 additional slides organized by topic.

### Navigation Tips

1. **Know your backup slides by number:** Practice saying "Let me show you slide B7 which has the detailed error analysis"

2. **Create a quick-reference index:** Have a single slide listing all backup slides with their numbers

3. **Use consistent formatting:** Make backups visually similar to main slides for smooth transitions

4. **Mark cross-references:** Note in presenter notes which backup slides relate to which main slides
