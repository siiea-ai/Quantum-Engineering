## Day 1984: Final Proofreading (Wednesday)

### Professional Proofreading Protocol

Proofreading is different from content review. Focus exclusively on surface errors.

#### Proofreading Techniques

**Technique 1: Read Aloud**
- Read every word aloud
- Forces attention to each word
- Catches awkward phrasing
- Identifies missing words

**Technique 2: Reverse Reading**
- Read paragraph by paragraph from end to beginning
- Breaks the flow that causes you to skip errors
- Forces attention to individual sentences

**Technique 3: Focus Sessions**
- 30-minute focused sessions
- Break between sessions
- Different chapters in different sessions

**Technique 4: Print Review**
- Print a hard copy
- Different visual presentation catches different errors
- Use colored pen for marking

**Technique 5: Fresh Eyes**
- If possible, have someone else proofread
- They will catch what you've become blind to
- Even one chapter helps

#### Common Errors to Check

**Spelling:**
- [ ] Run spell-check (but don't rely on it alone)
- [ ] Check technical terms manually
- [ ] Verify proper nouns
- [ ] Check for correct word choice (e.g., their/there/they're)

**Grammar:**
- [ ] Subject-verb agreement
- [ ] Tense consistency
- [ ] Pronoun references clear
- [ ] Parallel structure

**Punctuation:**
- [ ] Comma usage correct
- [ ] Semicolons and colons appropriate
- [ ] Quotation marks correct
- [ ] Hyphens and dashes appropriate

**Formatting Errors:**
- [ ] No extra spaces
- [ ] Consistent capitalization
- [ ] Abbreviations consistent
- [ ] Numbers formatted consistently

#### Proofreading Schedule

| Session | Focus | Duration | Completed |
|---------|-------|----------|-----------|
| Morning 1 | Chapters 1-2 | 60 min | [ ] |
| Morning 2 | Chapter 3 | 60 min | [ ] |
| Afternoon 1 | Chapters 4-5 | 90 min | [ ] |
| Afternoon 2 | Chapters 6-7 | 60 min | [ ] |
