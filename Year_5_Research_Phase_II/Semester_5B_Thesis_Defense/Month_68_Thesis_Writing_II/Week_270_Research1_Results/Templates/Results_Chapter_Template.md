### N.4.5 Negative Results and Failed Approaches

#### N.4.5.1 [Failed Approach 1]

**Template Structure:**

**Hypothesis**
[What we expected and why]

Based on [reasoning/literature/theory], we hypothesized that [expected outcome]. This approach was pursued because [justification].

**Approach**
[Detailed description of what was tried]

The investigation proceeded as follows:
1. [Step 1]
2. [Step 2]
3. [Step 3]

**Results**
[What was actually observed]

Figure N.X shows [unsuccessful result]. Contrary to expectations, [actual outcome]. The quantitative result was [value ± uncertainty], compared to the expected [expected value].

**Analysis**
[Why we believe this approach failed]

Several factors may explain the discrepancy between expectations and observations:
1. [Possible explanation 1]
2. [Possible explanation 2]
3. [Possible explanation 3]

Based on [analysis], we conclude that [most likely explanation].

**Lessons Learned**
[What this taught us]

This negative result informed our subsequent work in several ways:
1. [Lesson 1]: This led to [modification in approach]
2. [Lesson 2]: This constrained our interpretation of [other result]
3. [Lesson 3]: This suggests future work should [recommendation]

#### N.4.5.2 [Null Result]

**Template Structure:**

**Hypothesis**
[Expected effect]

We investigated whether [effect] was present, expecting [prediction] based on [reasoning].

**Experimental Design**
[How the experiment was designed to detect the effect]

**Results**
[Null result]

Figure N.X shows [data]. No statistically significant effect was observed. The measured value was [value ± uncertainty], consistent with zero within [N]σ.

**Statistical Power**
[Could we have detected the effect if it existed?]

Our measurement had sufficient sensitivity to detect an effect of magnitude [threshold] with [confidence level] confidence. The null result therefore places an upper limit of [limit] on [quantity].

**Interpretation**
[What the null result means]

This null result suggests that [interpretation], which is [consistent/inconsistent] with [theory/expectation]. This constrains models of [phenomenon] to [constraint].
