# Week 268: Literature Review Integration

## Days 1870-1876 | Thesis Writing I

---

## Overview

This week marks the culmination of Month 67's thesis writing phase. You will **integrate the literature review** throughout your introduction and background chapters, ensuring your work is properly positioned within the field. By Sunday, you should have a complete, polished draft of Chapters 1-2 ready for advisor review.

## Day-by-Day Breakdown

### Day 1870 (Monday): Literature Update and Search
**Goal:** Ensure your literature coverage is current and complete

**Morning Session: Systematic Search**

Conduct a systematic literature update:

1. **arXiv search** (quant-ph, cond-mat.mes-hall)
   - Keywords: [your specific topics]
   - Date range: January 2024 - present
   - Check new papers from key authors in your field

2. **Google Scholar**
   - Search your key terms
   - Check "Cited by" for foundational papers
   - Review recent reviews in your area

3. **Conference proceedings**
   - QIP 2024, 2025
   - APS March Meeting abstracts
   - IEEE Quantum Week

**Afternoon Session: Evaluation and Selection**

For each potentially relevant paper:

| Paper | Year | Relevance (1-5) | Include? | Where in thesis? |
|-------|------|-----------------|----------|------------------|
| | | | | |
| | | | | |
| | | | | |

Selection criteria:
- Directly relevant to your contributions
- Provides important context
- Represents the current state of the field
- From reputable venues/authors

**Evening Session: Organization**

- Add new references to your BibTeX file
- Categorize by topic/chapter
- Note where each should be cited

---

### Day 1871 (Tuesday): Introduction Literature Integration
**Goal:** Integrate literature throughout Chapter 1

**Morning Session: Motivation Section**

Review your motivation section and integrate:

1. **Field context references**
   - Key papers establishing the importance of the field
   - Recent progress highlighting the timeliness of your work
   - Major challenges your work addresses

2. **Specific problem references**
   - Papers that identified the gap you're filling
   - Prior approaches and their limitations
   - State-of-the-art benchmarks

Example integration:
> "Quantum error correction has advanced rapidly in recent years, with
> surface code demonstrations reaching error suppression below break-even
> [Google 2023, IBM 2024]. However, the overhead for fault-tolerant
> computation remains substantial [Gidney & Ekerå 2021], motivating the
> search for more efficient approaches."

**Afternoon Session: Research Questions**

For each research question, add:
- References to prior work that motivated the question
- Papers that provide partial answers
- Works your thesis extends

**Evening Session: Contributions**

Connect each contribution to the literature:
- What prior work enabled your contribution?
- How does your contribution advance beyond prior work?
- Which papers should readers consult for background?

---

### Day 1872 (Wednesday): Background Part 1 Literature Integration
**Goal:** Integrate literature into QM/QIT background sections

**Morning Session: Standard References**

Ensure proper citations for:
- Foundational quantum mechanics (Nielsen & Chuang, Preskill)
- Key theorems and definitions
- Historical developments where relevant

Integration pattern:
> "The von Neumann entropy $S(\rho) = -\Tr(\rho \log \rho)$ provides a
> fundamental measure of quantum information [von Neumann 1932, Nielsen
> & Chuang 2010]."

**Afternoon Session: Specialized References**

Add citations for:
- Specific techniques you use
- Results you'll invoke later
- Alternative approaches (briefly)

**Evening Session: Consistency Check**

- Verify all definitions cite appropriate sources
- Check that no claim goes uncited
- Ensure consistent citation format

---

### Day 1873 (Thursday): Background Part 2 Literature Integration
**Goal:** Integrate literature into QEC background sections

**Morning Session: QEC Foundations**

Cite appropriately for:
- Historical development (Shor, Steane, Gottesman, Knill-Laflamme)

- Recent developments (2024-2026)
- Experimental demonstrations

**Evening Session: Specialized Background**

Ensure your specialized section has:
- Foundational papers
- Recent advances
- Papers you directly build upon
- Concurrent work (acknowledge fairly)

---

### Day 1874 (Friday): Positioning and Voice Unification
**Goal:** Position your work and unify the narrative voice

**Morning Session: Positioning Paragraphs**

Write or refine positioning paragraphs that:
1. Summarize prior work in your specific area
2. Identify the gap or limitation your work addresses
3. Preview how your contributions fill the gap

Example positioning:
> "Prior work on biased-noise codes has established that the threshold can
> exceed 10% for highly biased noise [Tuckett et al. 2018, 2020; Li et al.
> 2019]. However, these analyses assumed idealized noise models and did
> not account for practical constraints such as limited connectivity and
> gate compilation overhead. This thesis bridges this gap by providing a
> comprehensive analysis incorporating realistic device constraints."

**Afternoon Session: Voice Unification**

Read Chapters 1-2 aloud and ensure:
- Consistent use of first person (we/I)
- Consistent active/passive balance
- Uniform paragraph structure
- Smooth transitions between sections

**Evening Session: Narrative Arc**

Verify the overall narrative:
1. Introduction hooks and motivates
2. Background educates and contextualizes
3. Research questions are well-grounded
4. Contributions are clearly positioned
5. Reader is prepared for research chapters

---

### Day 1875 (Saturday): Citation Verification
**Goal:** Verify all citations are accurate and complete

**Morning Session: Reference Check**

For every reference, verify:

| Citation | Authors Correct? | Year Correct? | Venue Correct? | DOI/arXiv? |
|----------|------------------|---------------|----------------|------------|
| | | | | |

Common errors to catch:
- Wrong year (publication vs. arXiv)
- Author name misspellings
- Incorrect venue (conference vs. journal)
- Missing DOI or arXiv identifier

**Afternoon Session: Citation Relevance**

For every citation, verify:
- The cited paper actually supports the claim
- You haven't misconstrued the cited result
- The citation is in the appropriate location

**Evening Session: Bibliography Cleanup**

- Ensure consistent formatting
- Remove duplicate entries
- Check for missing fields
- Verify all cited works are in bibliography

---

### Day 1876 (Sunday): Final Polish and Deliverable Preparation

## Literature Integration Techniques

### Technique 1: Contextual Citation

Weave references naturally into claims:

**Weak:**
> "Surface codes have been studied extensively [1-15]."

**Strong:**
> "Surface codes were introduced by Kitaev [2003] and have since become
> a leading approach for fault-tolerant quantum computing, with recent
> experiments demonstrating error suppression [Google 2023] and logical
> operations [IBM 2024]."

### Technique 2: Comparative Citation

Show how your work relates to others:

> "While prior approaches to noise-adapted codes focused on threshold
> optimization [Tuckett 2018, 2020], our work addresses the
> complementary question of practical implementation overhead [cf.
> Gidney 2021]."

### Technique 3: Foundational Citation

Cite foundational work for established concepts:

> "Quantum error correction was introduced by Shor [1995] and Steane
> [1996], with the stabilizer formalism developed by Gottesman [1997]."

### Technique 4: Recent Citation

Demonstrate awareness of recent progress:

> "Recent experimental advances have demonstrated surface code logical
> qubits [Acharya et al. 2024, Chen et al. 2025], bringing fault-tolerant
> quantum computing closer to practical realization."

## Citation Density Guidelines

Different sections require different citation densities:

| Section | Citation Density | Reasoning |
|---------|------------------|-----------|
| Introduction motivation | High (1-2 per paragraph) | Establish context |
| Research questions | Moderate (1 per question) | Ground in prior work |
| Contributions | Moderate | Connect to literature |
| QM/QIT background | Low-moderate | Standard material |
| QEC background | Moderate-high | Field-specific |
| Your specialized area | High | Demonstrate expertise |
| Positioning paragraphs | High | Show scholarly depth |

## Common Citation Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Citation Dumping
**Wrong:** "Many researchers have studied this [1-47]."
**Right:** Cite specifically and explain relevance.

### Mistake 2: Missing Key Citations
**Wrong:** Citing only your group's papers
**Right:** Fair coverage of the field, including competitors

### Mistake 3: Outdated References
**Wrong:** Most recent citation from 2020 in a rapidly moving field
**Right:** Include 2024-2026 references where relevant

### Mistake 4: Incorrect Attribution
**Wrong:** Attributing a result to the wrong paper
**Right:** Verify primary sources for major claims

### Mistake 5: Over-Citation
**Wrong:** Citing 5 papers for an uncontroversial claim
**Right:** 1-2 authoritative sources suffice

## Reference Management

### Recommended Tools

1. **Zotero** (free, browser integration, collaboration)
2. **Mendeley** (free, good PDF management)
3. **BibDesk** (Mac, direct BibTeX editing)
4. **JabRef** (cross-platform, BibTeX-native)

### BibTeX Best Practices

```bibtex
@article{lastname2024keyword,
  author  = {LastName, FirstName and ...},
  title   = {Full Title in Sentence Case},
  journal = {Full Journal Name},
  volume  = {XXX},
  pages   = {XXX--YYY},
  year    = {2024},
  doi     = {10.XXXX/...}
}
```

Key conventions:
- Cite key format: `lastname2024keyword`
- Complete author list (use "and others" only if >6)
- Full journal names (not abbreviations)
- Always include DOI when available
- Include arXiv ID for preprints

## Final Note

> "A literature review is not a shopping list of every paper ever written
> on a topic. It is a carefully constructed argument about what is known,
> what remains unknown, and why your contribution matters."

Your goal this week is to transform a collection of citations into a
coherent scholarly narrative. The reader should finish Chapters 1-2
understanding exactly why your research was necessary and how it builds
upon the foundations of the field.
