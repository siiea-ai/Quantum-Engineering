# Month 67: Thesis Writing I - Introduction and Background Chapters

## Status: 🔄 NOT STARTED

## Overview

Month 67 marks the beginning of the formal thesis writing phase, focusing on the foundational chapters that frame your research contributions. This month covers the **Introduction** and **Background** chapters—the narrative backbone that contextualizes your original work within the broader field of quantum science and engineering.

The goal is to produce **50+ pages of polished prose** that:
1. Articulates your research questions with precision and clarity
2. Establishes the theoretical foundations necessary to understand your contributions
3. Positions your work within the existing literature
4. Demonstrates mastery of quantum mechanics, quantum information theory, and quantum error correction

By the end of this month, you will have a complete draft of Chapters 1-2 ready for advisor review.

## Week-by-Week Breakdown

### Week 265: Introduction Chapter
**Days 1849-1855**

Focus on crafting a compelling introduction that hooks the reader and clearly states your research contributions. The introduction should be accessible to a general physics audience while signaling the technical depth to come.

Key tasks:
- Draft opening motivation (why does this research matter?)
- Articulate 3-5 specific research questions
- Summarize original contributions
- Write thesis roadmap

### Week 266: Background Part 1 - QM & QIT Foundations
**Days 1856-1862**

Establish the quantum mechanics and quantum information theory foundations necessary to understand your work. Focus on the specific concepts your thesis builds upon.

Key tasks:
- Quantum state formalism (pure and mixed states)
- Unitary evolution and measurement
- Entanglement and quantum correlations
- Quantum channels and operations
- Information-theoretic concepts (entropy, mutual information)

### Week 267: Background Part 2 - QEC & Field-Specific
**Days 1863-1869**

Cover quantum error correction fundamentals and the specialized background for your research area. This section bridges general knowledge to your specific contributions.

Key tasks:
- Error models and noise channels
- Stabilizer formalism
- Code families relevant to your work
- Fault-tolerant operations
- Your specialized area (topological codes, bosonic codes, etc.)

### Week 268: Literature Review Integration
**Days 1870-1876**

Weave the literature review throughout the background, positioning your work in context. Ensure all references are current and properly integrated.

Key tasks:
- Update literature to include 2025-2026 publications
- Position your contributions relative to prior work
- Identify and address gaps in coverage
- Verify all citations
- Polish and unify voice across chapters

## Assessment Criteria

Your draft will be evaluated on:

| Criterion | Weight | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| **Technical Accuracy** | 30% | Correct physics, proper derivations, accurate citations |
| **Clarity** | 25% | Understandable writing, logical flow, clear explanations |
| **Completeness** | 20% | Comprehensive coverage, no gaps, sufficient depth |
| **Originality of Framing** | 15% | Novel perspective, compelling narrative, clear positioning |
| **Professional Quality** | 10% | LaTeX formatting, figures, references, no typos |

---

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Too Much Background**: Focus on what's relevant to your thesis
2. **Too Little Background**: Don't assume reader knows your specialized area
3. **Passive Voice Overuse**: Be direct and clear
4. **Missing Connections**: Explicitly link background to your contributions
5. **Outdated References**: Check for recent relevant publications
6. **Inconsistent Notation**: Define once, use consistently
7. **Perfectionism Early**: Get words on paper, revise later
