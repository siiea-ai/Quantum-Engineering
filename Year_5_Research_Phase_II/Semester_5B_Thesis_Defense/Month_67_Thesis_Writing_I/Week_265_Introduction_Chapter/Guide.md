# Week 265: Writing the Thesis Introduction Chapter

## Days 1849-1855 | Thesis Writing I

---

## Overview

The introduction chapter is your thesis's first impression—the narrative gateway that draws readers into your research world. A masterful introduction accomplishes multiple objectives simultaneously: it motivates the research, articulates precise questions, establishes your contributions, and provides a roadmap for what follows.

This week, you will craft a **15-20 page introduction** that transforms five years of research into a compelling story. By Sunday, you should have a complete draft ready for revision.

## Day-by-Day Breakdown

### Day 1849 (Monday): Opening Motivation and Context
**Goal:** Write the opening 3-4 pages that hook the reader

**Morning Session: The Hook**
- Write 3 different opening paragraphs (choose best later)
- Establish broad context: Why quantum computing/information matters
- Narrow to your specific research domain

**Afternoon Session: Refinement**
- Select and polish the strongest opening
- Add 1-2 figures that visually motivate the problem
- Ensure accessibility to general physics audience

**Evening Session: Review**
- Read aloud for flow
- Check that each paragraph earns its place
- Note gaps to address tomorrow

**Writing Guidance:**

Your opening must accomplish three things:
1. **Capture attention** with a compelling statement or question
2. **Establish significance** by connecting to broader scientific/technological goals
3. **Signal focus** by narrowing to your specific area

Example opening structures:
- **The challenge opening**: "A fault-tolerant quantum computer requires..."
- **The historical opening**: "Since Shor's 1994 algorithm demonstrated..."
- **The vision opening**: "Imagine a computer that exploits..."
- **The gap opening**: "Despite remarkable progress in..., the problem of... remains open."

### Day 1850 (Tuesday): Research Questions and Hypotheses
**Goal:** Articulate your research questions with precision

**Morning Session: Question Formulation**
- Draft 3-5 specific research questions
- For each question, write a paragraph explaining:
  - Why this question matters
  - What was known before your work
  - What your work contributes

**Afternoon Session: Refinement**
- Ensure questions are specific and answerable
- Check that questions connect logically
- Add mathematical notation where appropriate

**Evening Session: Review**
- Verify questions align with your actual research
- Confirm hypotheses are falsifiable
- Check scope is appropriate for a PhD thesis

**Writing Guidance:**

Research questions must be:
- **Specific**: Not "How can we improve quantum error correction?" but "How does the threshold of the surface code depend on biased noise?"
- **Answerable**: Must be addressable with your methodology
- **Significant**: Must matter to the field
- **Novel**: Must not already be fully answered

Structure for each question:
```
RESEARCH QUESTION [N]: [Precise statement]

This question arises because [context/motivation]. Prior to this work,
[state of knowledge]. We hypothesize that [your conjecture].
Answering this question is important because [significance].
```

---

### Day 1851 (Wednesday): Statement of Contributions
**Goal:** Clearly articulate your original contributions

**Morning Session: Contributions List**
- Write a numbered list of 4-7 original contributions
- For each contribution, draft 1-2 paragraphs explaining:
  - What you did
  - Why it's novel
  - What impact it has

**Afternoon Session: Evidence and Context**
- Add references to your publications
- Connect each contribution to a research question
- Include quantitative results where applicable

**Evening Session: Review**
- Verify claims are accurate and defensible
- Ensure contributions are appropriately scoped
- Check for proper attribution of collaborative work

**Writing Guidance:**

Contributions should be:
- **Concrete**: "We prove that..." not "We explore..."
- **Novel**: Clearly distinguish from prior work
- **Significant**: Explain why each matters
- **Verifiable**: Point to specific results

Example contribution statements:

> **Contribution 1: Noise-Adapted Surface Codes**
> We develop a family of surface code variants optimized for biased noise channels.
> Specifically, we show that by deforming the standard surface code lattice according
> to the noise bias ratio $\eta = p_Z/p_X$, the code threshold can be improved by
> up to 40% compared to the standard square lattice [Chapters 3-4, Ref: Your Paper 2024].

> **Contribution 2: Efficient Decoding Algorithm**
> We introduce a tensor-network decoder that achieves near-optimal performance
> with polynomial computational cost. Our decoder runs in $O(d^3)$ time for a
> distance-$d$ code, compared to $O(2^d)$ for exact maximum-likelihood decoding
> [Chapter 5, Ref: Your Paper 2025].

### Day 1852 (Thursday): Thesis Structure and Roadmap
**Goal:** Write the thesis roadmap section

**Morning Session: Chapter Summaries**
- Write 1-2 paragraph summaries of each chapter
- Explain how chapters connect logically
- Highlight key results from each chapter

**Afternoon Session: Visual Roadmap**
- Create a thesis structure diagram
- Design a figure showing chapter relationships
- Add cross-references between chapters

**Evening Session: Review**
- Verify roadmap covers all content
- Check that chapter summaries are accurate
- Ensure logical flow is clear

**Writing Guidance:**

The roadmap serves multiple purposes:
- **Navigation**: Helps readers find specific content
- **Coherence**: Shows how pieces fit together
- **Commitment**: Sets expectations you must meet

Structure your roadmap as follows:

```
This thesis is organized as follows:

**Chapter 2: Background** establishes the theoretical foundations...

**Chapter 3: [First Research Chapter]** addresses Research Question 1 by...

**Chapter 4: [Second Research Chapter]** extends the results of Chapter 3 to...

**Chapter 5: [Third Research Chapter]** develops computational tools for...

**Chapter 6: Conclusions** summarizes our contributions and discusses...

Figure 1.1 illustrates the relationships between chapters.
```

### Day 1853 (Friday): Theoretical and Practical Motivation
**Goal:** Deepen the motivation section

**Morning Session: Theoretical Motivation**
- Explain why your research questions are theoretically interesting
- Connect to fundamental physics or mathematics
- Reference key theoretical results that inspire your work

**Afternoon Session: Practical Motivation**
- Discuss applications and technological relevance
- Reference industry efforts (Google, IBM, etc.)
- Include timeline/roadmap for practical quantum computing

**Evening Session: Review**
- Balance theoretical and practical motivations
- Ensure claims about applications are realistic
- Update any outdated industry references

**Writing Guidance:**

Balance two perspectives:

**Theoretical Motivation:**
- Connections to fundamental physics (many-body physics, topological phases)
- Mathematical structure and elegance
- Open problems in theoretical computer science
- Information-theoretic questions

**Practical Motivation:**
- Current experimental progress
- Industrial quantum computing efforts
- Timeline to fault-tolerance
- Economic and societal impact

Example:
> From a theoretical perspective, topological quantum codes reveal deep connections
> between quantum error correction and topological phases of matter. The toric code,
> for instance, realizes a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological order with anyonic excitations
> [Kitaev 2003]. Understanding how this topological structure protects information
> advances our understanding of both quantum computing and condensed matter physics.
>
> From a practical perspective, topological codes are leading candidates for
> near-term fault-tolerant quantum computing. Google's recent experiments have
> demonstrated surface code logical qubits [Acharya et al. 2024], and current
> roadmaps suggest fault-tolerant operations within the decade. Our work on
> noise-adapted variants directly addresses the performance gap between current
> experiments and theoretical thresholds.

### Day 1854 (Saturday): Integration and Flow
**Goal:** Unify all sections into a coherent chapter

**Morning Session: Integration**
- Arrange all sections in logical order
- Write transition paragraphs between sections
- Ensure consistent voice throughout

**Afternoon Session: Flow and Polish**
- Read entire chapter aloud
- Identify and fix awkward transitions
- Strengthen topic sentences

**Evening Session: Formatting**
- Format equations and references
- Add section labels for cross-references
- Check figure placements

**Writing Guidance:**

Transitions are crucial for flow. Each section should:
1. Briefly recall what came before
2. Explain why the new section follows logically
3. Preview what the section will accomplish

Example transition:
> Having established the significance of quantum error correction for fault-tolerant
> computing, we now turn to the specific research questions addressed in this thesis.
> These questions arose from our analysis of the gap between theoretical code
> performance and experimental realizations.

---

### Day 1855 (Sunday): Review and Revision
**Goal:** Complete a polished draft of the introduction

**Morning Session: Deep Revision**
- Re-read with fresh eyes
- Cut unnecessary content ruthlessly
- Strengthen weak arguments

**Afternoon Session: Technical Check**
- Verify all equations are correct
- Check all references are accurate
- Ensure figures are high-quality

**Evening Session: Final Polish**

1. Review your introduction's research questions—what background do readers need?
2. Identify the specific QM/QIT concepts your thesis builds upon
3. Gather key references (Nielsen & Chuang, Preskill's notes, etc.)
4. Outline the background sections

## Motivational Note

> "The introduction is not just an opening—it's a promise to your reader about what
> they will learn. Make it a promise you can keep, and then exceed their expectations."

The introduction sets the trajectory for your entire thesis. Invest the time to make it excellent, and the remaining chapters will flow more naturally.
