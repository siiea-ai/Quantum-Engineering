# Cross-Project Connection Map

## Purpose

This document provides a structured framework for identifying, documenting, and articulating the connections between Research Project 1 (R1) and Research Project 2 (R2) in your doctoral thesis. A well-crafted cross-project connection map demonstrates the intellectual coherence of your doctoral work and shows your development as an independent researcher.

## Part I: Thematic Connections

### 1.1 Central Research Theme

**Unifying Theme:**
> [Describe the overarching theme that connects both research projects]

**Theme Statement:**
> My doctoral research addresses [central question/problem] through [approach]. R1 explored [aspect 1], while R2 extends this to [aspect 2], together providing [comprehensive understanding].

### 1.2 Research Question Evolution

| Stage | Question | Project |
|-------|----------|---------|
| Initial | [Broad question that motivated doctoral work] | Pre-research |
| Refined | [More specific question addressed by R1] | R1 |
| Extended | [Question arising from R1 findings] | R1→R2 |
| Focused | [Precise question addressed by R2] | R2 |
| Synthesized | [Unified question answered by combined work] | Synthesis |

**Narrative Evolution:**
> The initial question of [broad question] led to the specific investigation of [R1 question] in Research Project 1. Our finding that [R1 key result] raised the natural follow-up question of [bridge question], which became the focus of Research Project 2. The combined findings now allow us to address the more fundamental question of [synthesis question].
