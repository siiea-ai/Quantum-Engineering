### 2.2 Contribution Scope Assessment

For each contribution, assess appropriate scope:

**Overclaiming Indicators:**
- Using "prove" instead of "demonstrate" or "establish"
- Claiming universality without testing
- Ignoring contradictory evidence
- Overstating practical implications

**Underclaiming Indicators:**
- Excessive hedging ("might possibly suggest")
- Failing to state implications
- Hiding contributions in methods
- Comparing unfavorably to much larger efforts

**Appropriate Scoping:**

| Statement Type | Too Narrow | Appropriate | Too Broad |
|----------------|------------|-------------|-----------|
| What we showed | "Our data are consistent with..." | "We demonstrate that..." | "We prove that..." |
| Generality | "For our specific sample..." | "For [defined class]..." | "For all quantum systems..." |
| Implications | "This might have implications..." | "This enables..." | "This solves the problem of..." |

### 4.2 Example Contribution Write-up

**Contribution 1: Universal Framework for Noise-Filtered Quantum Coherence**

This thesis develops a universal framework for understanding and optimizing coherence in driven quantum systems. Prior to this work, coherence protection was approached through system-specific heuristics, with limited transferability between platforms. We establish that noise filtering through dynamical decoupling follows universal principles captured by the filter function formalism, and we extend this formalism to include pulse shaping effects.

The contribution is supported by extensive experimental data across multiple noise environments (Chapter 4) and theoretical development validated against both our experiments and independent results from the literature (Chapter 3). Key quantitative results include:
- The filter function framework predicts coherence times within 10% for noise correlation times spanning three orders of magnitude (10 μs to 10 ms)
- The framework correctly predicts the optimal pulse spacing for non-Markovian noise environments
- Extension to shaped pulses provides an additional 1.8x coherence improvement

The significance of this contribution lies in enabling rational design of coherence protection protocols. Rather than trial-and-error optimization, practitioners can now use the framework to predict optimal control strategies for any characterized noise environment. The framework has been adopted by three research groups [citations] and has been incorporated into quantum control software packages [references].

This represents, to our knowledge, the first comprehensive experimental validation of the filter function framework across multiple noise regimes and pulse types, and the first extension to include arbitrary pulse shapes in the filter function calculation.

## Part VI: Common Problems and Solutions

### Problem: Contributions Sound Like Activities

**Wrong:** "We measured coherence times in multiple samples."

**Right:** "We established that coherence times are inversely proportional to environmental noise power, providing a predictive relationship for system optimization."

### Problem: Contributions Are Too Narrow

**Wrong:** "We achieved T₂ = 245 μs in sample A."

**Right:** "We demonstrated that optimized dynamical decoupling achieves coherence times exceeding 200 μs in superconducting qubits, approaching the limit required for fault-tolerant quantum computing."

### Problem: Contributions Are Too Broad

**Wrong:** "We solved the decoherence problem."

**Right:** "We developed and validated techniques that extend coherence times by 3x under specific noise conditions, demonstrating a path toward meeting fault-tolerance thresholds."

### Problem: Contributions Are Hidden

**Solution:** Explicitly state contributions in:
- Abstract
- Introduction (preview)
- Conclusions (detailed)
- Chapter summaries
