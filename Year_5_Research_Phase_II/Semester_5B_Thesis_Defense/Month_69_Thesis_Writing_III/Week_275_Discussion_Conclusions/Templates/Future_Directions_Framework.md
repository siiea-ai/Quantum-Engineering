# Future Directions Framework

## Guiding the Next Generation of Research

---

## Purpose

The future directions section of your thesis serves multiple purposes: it demonstrates your understanding of the field's trajectory, provides guidance for researchers who will build on your work, and shows committee members that you can envision research beyond your doctoral project. This framework helps you develop thoughtful, specific, and impactful future directions.

## Part III: Writing Guidelines

### 3.1 Being Specific vs. Vague

| Vague (Avoid) | Specific (Preferred) |
|---------------|---------------------|
| "Future work should explore other systems" | "Future work should extend to trapped ion systems, where the different noise spectrum (dominated by motional heating at ~1 kHz) would test our framework's prediction of 5x coherence enhancement" |
| "Better techniques are needed" | "Development of real-time noise spectroscopy, enabling adaptive pulse sequence optimization, could improve coherence by an additional factor of 2" |
| "Applications should be investigated" | "Integration with surface code error correction would test whether our coherence improvements translate to reduced logical error rates" |

### 3.2 Being Realistic vs. Speculative

**Realistic future directions:**
- Build directly on thesis results
- Require achievable resources
- Have clear success criteria
- Can be completed in reasonable timeframe

**Speculative directions (use sparingly):**
- Require significant breakthroughs
- Depend on uncertain developments
- Have unclear path forward
- Represent transformative but uncertain possibilities

**Balance:** 70% realistic, 30% speculative is appropriate

### 3.3 Being Generous

Your future directions should enable others to build on your work:
- Share insights about what would work
- Warn about pitfalls you discovered
- Provide specific starting points
- Acknowledge related work that could contribute

### 3.4 Connecting to Your Contributions

Each future direction should connect to your thesis contributions:

> "Building on Contribution 2 (the noise filtering framework), future work should..."
