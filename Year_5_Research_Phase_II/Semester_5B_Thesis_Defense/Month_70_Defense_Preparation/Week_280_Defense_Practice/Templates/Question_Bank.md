## How to Use This Document

1. **Read through all questions** to understand the range of what might be asked
2. **Draft answer frameworks** for each question (key points, not full scripts)
3. **Practice answering aloud** - speaking is different from thinking
4. **Track your confidence** for each question
5. **Focus extra practice** on low-confidence questions
6. **Update with questions** from mock defenses
