## Part 5: Q&A Protocol

### For the Candidate

**Answering Process:**
1. Listen to the complete question
2. Pause to think (3-5 seconds is okay)
3. Clarify if needed: "If I understand correctly, you're asking..."
4. Provide direct answer first
5. Add explanation/evidence
6. Check: "Does that address your question?"

**If You Don't Know:**
- Acknowledge what you do know
- Explain your reasoning
- Describe how you would find out
- Be honest: "I don't know, but..."

### For Mock Committee

**Question Types to Ask:**

| Type | Examples | Frequency |
|------|----------|-----------|
| Technical | "How did you calibrate X?" | 30% |
| Interpretation | "Could Y explain this result?" | 25% |
| Context | "How does this compare to Author's work?" | 20% |
| Future | "What would you do next?" | 15% |
| Foundational | "Explain concept Z" | 10% |

**Difficulty Distribution:**

- 40% moderately challenging
- 20% difficult/probing

**Behavior Guidelines:**
