## Part 5: Answer Frameworks

### Framework for Unknown Questions

When you don't know the answer:
1. Acknowledge what you do know that's relevant
2. Explain your thought process
3. Discuss how you would find out
4. Be honest about the limits of your knowledge

**Example:** "That's an interesting question I haven't fully considered. Based on my understanding of [related topic], I would expect [hypothesis]. To answer this definitively, I would need to [approach]. This is something I'd like to explore in future work."

### Framework for Critical Questions

When facing criticism:
1. Thank the questioner for the insight
2. Acknowledge the validity of the concern
3. Explain your reasoning or limitations
4. Describe what you would do differently or next

**Example:** "You raise an important point. We did consider [alternative approach], but chose our method because [reasoning]. You're right that this introduces [limitation]. In future work, we plan to [improvement]."

### Framework for Broad Questions

When the question is very open:
1. Ask for clarification if needed
2. Choose a focused angle to address
3. Provide a concrete answer
4. Offer to expand on other aspects

**Example:** "That's a broad question. Let me focus on [specific aspect], and I'm happy to discuss other angles afterward. The key point is [focused answer]..."
