# Week 278: Thesis Revision Guide (Days 1940-1946)

## Overview

Week 278 transforms your complete draft into a polished manuscript ready for committee review. This week focuses on systematic revision at multiple levels: document-wide consistency, chapter-level coherence, paragraph-level clarity, and sentence-level precision. You will conduct a complete read-through, verify all figures and tables, ensure consistent formatting, and conduct your second mock defense with peer reviewers.

Revision is not merely proofreading. It is a rigorous process of evaluating and improving your argument, organization, evidence, and presentation. Approach this week with fresh eyes and a willingness to make substantive changes for the sake of clarity and impact.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of Week 278, you will be able to:

1. Conduct systematic multi-pass revision for content, structure, and style
2. Verify consistency of notation, terminology, and formatting across chapters
3. Audit all figures and tables for quality, accuracy, and completeness
4. Ensure citation accuracy and bibliographic completeness
5. Polish prose for clarity, precision, and scholarly tone
6. Integrate peer feedback from second mock defense

## Revision Strategies

### Multi-Pass Revision Approach

Effective revision requires multiple focused passes, each with a specific goal:

**Pass 1: Content and Argument (Day 1940)**
- Is the research question clearly stated and answered?
- Are all claims supported by evidence?
- Is the argument logical and convincing?
- Are there gaps in the reasoning?

**Pass 2: Structure and Organization (Day 1941)**
- Does the structure serve the argument?
- Are transitions smooth?
- Is information in the right place?
- Is the length appropriate for each section?

**Pass 3: Technical Accuracy (Days 1942-1944)**
- Are all technical details correct?
- Is notation consistent?
- Are citations accurate?
- Are figures and tables clear?

**Pass 4: Style and Clarity (Day 1945)**
- Is the writing clear and precise?
- Are sentences well-constructed?
- Is the tone appropriately scholarly?
- Have all errors been corrected?

### Reading Strategies

**Change the medium:**
- Print on paper if you usually read on screen
- Use a different screen or font
- Read aloud to catch awkward phrasing
- Have text-to-speech software read it

**Change your perspective:**
- Read as if you are a committee member
- Read as if you are a new graduate student
- Read as if you are reviewing for a journal
- Read as if you are your harshest critic

**Change the order:**
- Read chapters out of order
- Read paragraphs in reverse order
- Read only topic sentences
- Read only figure captions

### Common Issues to Address

**Structural Issues:**
- Chapters that don't contribute to main argument
- Sections in wrong order
- Missing transitions
- Redundant content across chapters
- Disproportionate section lengths

**Technical Issues:**
- Inconsistent notation (σ vs. Σ, ℏ vs. h-bar)
- Undefined abbreviations
- Incorrect units
- Missing error bars
- Unsupported claims

**Writing Issues:**
- Passive voice overuse
- Vague language ("it is known that...")
- Overly long sentences
- Informal language
- Repetitive phrasing

## Common Revision Pitfalls

### Pitfall 1: Endless Revision
**Problem:** Never feeling "done"
**Solution:** Set clear stopping criteria; accept diminishing returns

### Pitfall 2: Superficial Revision
**Problem:** Only fixing typos, missing structural issues
**Solution:** Use multi-pass approach with specific foci

### Pitfall 3: Ignoring Feedback
**Problem:** Dismissing legitimate criticism
**Solution:** Assume all feedback has merit; understand before dismissing

### Pitfall 4: Over-Revision
**Problem:** Introducing new errors while fixing old ones
**Solution:** Track all changes; review modifications carefully

### Pitfall 5: Last-Minute Major Changes
**Problem:** Making substantive changes late in process
**Solution:** Major changes only if absolutely necessary; add time for review
