SCALABLE QUANTUM ERROR CORRECTION IN SUPERCONDUCTING CIRCUITS

Jane Q. Researcher

Professor John Smith, Advisor

Fault-tolerant quantum computation requires protecting quantum information
from environmental decoherence while maintaining the ability to perform
logical operations. Current implementations of quantum error correction
face significant challenges in scaling beyond proof-of-principle
demonstrations due to limited coherence times and gate fidelities.

This thesis addresses these challenges through three complementary
approaches. First, we developed an optimized surface code implementation
using transmon qubits, demonstrating a 47% reduction in logical error
rate compared to previous designs. Second, we introduced a novel
syndrome extraction protocol that reduces the measurement overhead by
a factor of 2.3 while maintaining error correction capability. Third,
we demonstrated real-time decoding with a custom FPGA-based decoder
achieving sub-microsecond latency.

Our experiments with a 17-qubit surface code patch show logical qubit
lifetimes exceeding 100 microseconds, representing a five-fold improvement
over physical qubit coherence. We observe the predicted threshold behavior,
with logical error rates decreasing as code distance increases beyond d=3.

These results establish a viable path toward fault-tolerant quantum
computation with superconducting circuits and provide essential building
blocks for larger-scale implementations. The techniques developed here
are directly applicable to next-generation quantum processors targeting
thousands of physical qubits.

### Abstract Writing Tips

**Do:**
- State the problem clearly in the first sentence
- Use specific numbers and quantitative results
- Highlight what is new about your work
- Write for a broad scientific audience
- Use past tense for what you did; present for established facts

**Don't:**
- Include citations
- Use undefined abbreviations
- Include figures or tables
- Exceed the word limit
- Use overly technical jargon

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

I am profoundly grateful to my advisor, Professor Elena Martinez,
for her mentorship over the past five years. Her scientific vision
shaped the direction of this work, while her patience and encouragement
helped me through the inevitable challenges of doctoral research.
Elena taught me not just how to do science, but how to think like
a scientist. I could not have asked for a better mentor.

I thank my dissertation committee members for their invaluable
guidance: Professor James Chen, whose insights on quantum optics
fundamentally improved Chapter 4; Professor Sarah Williams, who
challenged me to think more carefully about error analysis; and
Professor Michael Brown, whose questions about applications
broadened my perspective on this work's impact.

This research was enriched by collaborations with the Quantum
Devices group at National Laboratory. I thank Dr. Robert Kim
for providing device samples, Dr. Lisa Park for measurement
assistance, and the entire team for stimulating discussions
during my summer visits.

The Martinez Lab has been an intellectual home for five years.
I thank my labmates—past and present—for countless discussions,
debugging sessions, and coffee breaks: Alex, Maria, David, Wei,
Priya, and Jordan. Special thanks to Dr. Thomas Anderson, who
mentored me as a first-year student and remains a valued colleague.

This work was supported by the National Science Foundation (Grant
No. PHY-1234567), the Department of Energy Office of Science
(Grant No. DE-SC0012345), and the [University] Quantum Science
Fellowship. I also acknowledge support from the ARPA-E ULTIMATE
program for the work in Chapter 5.

I thank Jennifer Walsh in the Physics Department office for
navigating countless administrative challenges, and the technical
staff of the [Facility Name] for maintaining the equipment that
made this work possible.

Finally, I thank my family—Mom, Dad, and my sister Rachel—for
their love and support throughout my education. To my partner,
Chris: thank you for your patience during late nights in the lab,
your encouragement during setbacks, and your unwavering belief
in me. This thesis is as much yours as it is mine.
