# Week 69: Identical Particles

## Overview

**Week 69** | Days 477-483 | Quantum Statistics Foundations

This week introduces the quantum mechanics of identical particles—one of the most profound departures from classical physics. The symmetrization postulate fundamentally constrains multi-particle wave functions.

## Key Concepts

### The Indistinguishability Principle

In quantum mechanics, identical particles are truly **indistinguishable**—not just hard to tell apart, but fundamentally impossible to distinguish. This leads to:

1. Exchange symmetry requirements
2. Quantum statistics (Bose-Einstein, Fermi-Dirac)
3. The Pauli exclusion principle

### The Symmetrization Postulate

For N identical particles:
- **Bosons:** Wave function symmetric under exchange
- **Fermions:** Wave function antisymmetric under exchange

### Classification

| Particle Type | Spin | Statistics | Wave Function |
|---------------|------|------------|---------------|
| Bosons | 0, 1, 2, ... | Bose-Einstein | Symmetric |
| Fermions | 1/2, 3/2, ... | Fermi-Dirac | Antisymmetric |

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this week, you will be able to:

1. Apply the exchange operator to multi-particle states
2. Construct symmetric (bosonic) wave functions
3. Construct antisymmetric (fermionic) wave functions using Slater determinants
4. Explain the spin-statistics theorem
5. Apply the Pauli exclusion principle
6. Calculate exchange interactions and their physical effects
