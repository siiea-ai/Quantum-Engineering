---

## 4. Problem-Solving Strategies

### General Approach

1. **Identify the system:** What are the degrees of freedom?
2. **Write the Hamiltonian:** What's the kinetic + potential energy?
3. **Look for symmetry:** Conservation laws? Good quantum numbers?
4. **Choose method:** Exact solution? Perturbation? Variational? Numerical?
5. **Solve and interpret:** What do the results mean physically?

### Method Selection Guide

| Situation | Recommended Approach |
|-----------|---------------------|
| Known exact solution exists | Direct solution |
| Small perturbation to known system | Perturbation theory |
| Ground state energy needed | Variational method |
| Semiclassical regime | WKB approximation |
| Scattering problem | Born or partial waves |
| Numerical required | Computational methods |

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Forgetting normalization** of wave functions
2. **Sign errors** in commutators and cross products
3. **Incorrect boundary conditions** in radial problems
4. **Mixing up** first vs second order perturbation
5. **Neglecting** degeneracy when it matters
6. **Confusing** phase shifts and scattering amplitudes

---

## 5. Comprehensive Self-Assessment

### Part A: Conceptual Questions (30 minutes)

**A1.** Explain why the position and momentum operators cannot share a complete set of eigenstates. What does this imply physically?

**A2.** A particle in an infinite square well is in a superposition $|\psi\rangle = (|1\rangle + |2\rangle)/\sqrt{2}$. Describe the time evolution and calculate $\langle x \rangle(t)$.

**A3.** Why do electrons in atoms occupy discrete orbitals rather than any arbitrary energy? Connect this to the mathematical structure of quantum mechanics.

**A4.** Explain the physical origin of exchange energy in helium. Why does it make the singlet and triplet states have different energies?

**A5.** What does the optical theorem tell us about the relationship between forward scattering and total absorption? Give a physical interpretation.

### Part B: Mathematical Problems (45 minutes)

**B1.** For the Hamiltonian $\hat{H} = \frac{\hat{p}^2}{2m} + \frac{1}{2}m\omega^2\hat{x}^2 + \lambda\hat{x}^4$, calculate the first-order energy correction to the ground state.

**B2.** Use the variational method with trial function $\psi(x) = Ne^{-\alpha x^2}$ to estimate the ground state energy of a particle in a linear potential $V(x) = F|x|$.

**B3.** Calculate the p-wave phase shift for a hard sphere of radius $R$ at wave number $k$. Express the result in terms of $kR$.

**B4.** Two spin-1/2 particles are in the state $|\psi\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}|+,+\rangle + \sqrt{\frac{2}{3}}|+,-\rangle$. Calculate:
(a) $\langle \hat{S}_{1z} \rangle$
(b) $\langle \hat{S}^2_{total} \rangle$

**B5.** A neutron scatters from a nucleus with a resonance at $E_R = 1$ MeV and width $\Gamma = 100$ keV. Calculate the cross section at $E = E_R$ and at $E = E_R + \Gamma$.

### Part C: Synthesis Questions (15 minutes)

**C1.** Trace the logical path from the postulates of quantum mechanics to the periodic table of elements.

**C2.** How would quantum mechanics be different if fermions obeyed Bose-Einstein statistics instead? What physical consequences would follow?
