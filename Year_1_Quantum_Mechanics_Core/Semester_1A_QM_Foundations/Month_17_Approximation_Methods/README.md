# Month 17: Perturbation Theory & Approximation Methods

## Overview
**Days 449-476** | Year 1, Month 17 | Semester 1A: QM Foundations

This month develops the essential approximation techniques that make quantum mechanics applicable to real-world problems. When exact solutions aren't available, these methods provide powerful ways to obtain physical predictions.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this month, you will be able to:
1. Apply time-independent perturbation theory to calculate energy corrections
2. Handle degenerate perturbation theory systematically
3. Use the variational method to bound ground state energies
4. Apply WKB approximation for semiclassical problems
5. Calculate transition rates using time-dependent perturbation theory
6. Derive Fermi's golden rule and apply selection rules
