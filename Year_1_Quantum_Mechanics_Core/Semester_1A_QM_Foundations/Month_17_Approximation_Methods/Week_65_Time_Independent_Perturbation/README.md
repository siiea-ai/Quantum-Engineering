# Week 65: Time-Independent Perturbation Theory

## Overview
**Days 449-455** | Month 17, Week 65 | When Exact Solutions Don't Exist

This week develops time-independent perturbation theory — the systematic method for finding approximate energy eigenvalues and eigenstates when the Hamiltonian differs slightly from an exactly solvable system.

## Daily Schedule

| Day | Topic | Key Formula |
|-----|-------|-------------|
| 449 | Non-Degenerate PT I | E^(1) = ⟨n⁰|H'|n⁰⟩ |
| 450 | Non-Degenerate PT II | E^(2) = Σ |⟨m|H'|n⟩|²/(E_n - E_m) |
| 451 | Degenerate PT I | det(H' - E^(1)I) = 0 |
| 452 | Degenerate PT II | Good basis states |
| 453 | Fine Structure Application | Complete hydrogen treatment |
| 454 | Stark Effect | Electric field perturbation |
| 455 | Week Review | Perturbation theory summary |

## Key Concepts

### The Setup
$$H = H_0 + \lambda H'$$

where H₀ is solvable and λH' is a small perturbation.

### Non-Degenerate Formulas
$$E_n = E_n^{(0)} + \lambda E_n^{(1)} + \lambda^2 E_n^{(2)} + ...$$

### First-Order Energy
$$E_n^{(1)} = \langle n^{(0)} | H' | n^{(0)} \rangle$$

### Second-Order Energy
$$E_n^{(2)} = \sum_{m \neq n} \frac{|\langle m^{(0)} | H' | n^{(0)} \rangle|^2}{E_n^{(0)} - E_m^{(0)}}$$

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this week, you will be able to:
1. Calculate first and second-order energy corrections
2. Find perturbed wavefunctions to first order
3. Handle degenerate perturbation theory
4. Apply to atomic physics problems
5. Assess convergence and validity
