# Week 67: WKB Approximation

## Overview
**Days 463-469** | Month 17, Week 67 | Semiclassical Methods

This week develops the WKB (Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin) approximation — the bridge between classical and quantum mechanics, essential for tunneling and quantization.

## Daily Schedule

| Day | Topic | Key Concept |
|-----|-------|-------------|
| 463 | Semiclassical Limit | ℏ → 0, classical momentum p(x) |
| 464 | WKB Wavefunctions | ψ ∝ exp(±i∫p dx/ℏ)/√p |
| 465 | Connection Formulas | Turning points, Airy functions |
| 466 | Bound State Quantization | Bohr-Sommerfeld: ∮p dx = (n+1/2)h |
| 467 | Tunneling Rates | Gamow factor T = exp(-2∫κ dx) |
| 468 | Above-Barrier Reflection | Quantum reflection |
| 469 | Week Review | WKB summary |

## Key Formulas

### WKB Wavefunction (Classically Allowed)
$$\psi(x) = \frac{A}{\sqrt{p(x)}}\exp\left(\pm\frac{i}{\hbar}\int p(x)\,dx\right)$$

### Bohr-Sommerfeld Quantization
$$\oint p(x)\,dx = \left(n + \frac{1}{2}\right)h$$

### Tunneling Probability
$$T \approx \exp\left(-\frac{2}{\hbar}\int_{x_1}^{x_2}|p(x)|\,dx\right)$$
