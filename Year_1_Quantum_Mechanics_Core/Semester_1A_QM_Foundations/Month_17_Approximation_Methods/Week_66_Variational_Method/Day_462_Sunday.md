# Day 462: Week 66 Review — Variational Method

## Overview
**Day 462** | Year 1, Month 17, Week 66 | Comprehensive Review

---

## Week 66 Summary

### The Variational Principle
$$E[\psi] = \langle\psi|H|\psi\rangle \geq E_0$$

### Key Results

| System | Trial Function | Result |
|--------|----------------|--------|
| H atom | e^{-αr} | Exact E₀ |
| He atom | e^{-Z_eff(r₁+r₂)} | -77.5 eV (98%) |
| H₂⁺ | LCAO | Qualitative bonding |

### Linear Variational Method
$$\det(\mathbf{H} - E\mathbf{S}) = 0$$

### Quantum Computing: VQE

1. Prepare |ψ(θ)⟩ on quantum computer
2. Measure ⟨H⟩
3. Classical optimization of θ
4. Converge to ground state
