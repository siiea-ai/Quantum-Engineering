# Week 66: Variational Method

## Overview
**Days 456-462** | Month 17, Week 66 | Upper Bounds on Ground State Energy

This week develops the variational method — a powerful approach that provides rigorous upper bounds on ground state energies without requiring the perturbation to be small.

## Daily Schedule

| Day | Topic | Key Concept |
|-----|-------|-------------|
| 456 | Variational Principle | E[ψ] ≥ E₀ |
| 457 | Trial Wavefunctions | Parameter optimization |
| 458 | Helium Atom | Two-electron ground state |
| 459 | Hydrogen Molecule Ion | H₂⁺ bonding |
| 460 | Linear Variational Method | Secular determinant |
| 461 | Ritz Method | Systematic improvement |
| 462 | Week Review | Variational summary |

## Key Concepts

### Variational Principle
$$E[\psi] = \frac{\langle\psi|H|\psi\rangle}{\langle\psi|\psi\rangle} \geq E_0$$

Equality holds only when ψ is the true ground state.
