# Day 442: Nuclear Spin

## Overview
**Day 442** | Year 1, Month 16, Week 64 | The Proton's Magnetic Moment

Today we introduce nuclear spin and the proton's magnetic moment, which leads to hyperfine structure.

## Learning Objectives

1. Understand nuclear spin quantum numbers
2. Calculate the proton magnetic moment
3. Compare nuclear and electronic magnetons
4. Understand the scale of hyperfine vs fine structure
5. Define total angular momentum F = J + I

## Core Content

### Nuclear Spin

The proton has:
- Spin I = 1/2
- Magnetic moment: μ_p = g_p (e/2m_p) I

### Nuclear Magneton

$$\mu_N = \frac{e\hbar}{2m_p} = \frac{m_e}{m_p}\mu_B \approx \frac{\mu_B}{1836}$$

### Proton g-Factor

Experimentally: g_p ≈ 5.59 (anomalous!)

$$\mu_p = g_p \mu_N \mathbf{I}/\hbar \approx 2.79 \mu_N$$

### Scale Comparison

$$\frac{E_{\text{HF}}}{E_{\text{FS}}} \sim \frac{m_e}{m_p} \approx \frac{1}{2000}$$

Hyperfine structure is ~1000× smaller than fine structure!

### Total Angular Momentum F

$$\mathbf{F} = \mathbf{J} + \mathbf{I}$$

For hydrogen ground state (J = 1/2, I = 1/2):
- F = 0 or F = 1

## Practice Problems

1. Calculate μ_N in SI units.
2. What F values are possible for the 2P_{3/2} state?
3. Why is the proton g-factor anomalous?

## Summary

| Quantity | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Nuclear magneton | μ_N = μ_B/1836 |
| Proton g-factor | g_p ≈ 5.59 |
| Total F | J + I, ..., |J - I| |
