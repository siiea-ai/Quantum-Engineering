# Week 62: The Hydrogen Atom

## Overview
**Days 428-434** | Month 16, Week 62 | The Most Important Atom

This week we solve the hydrogen atom — the cornerstone of atomic physics and chemistry. This exactly solvable system provides the foundation for understanding all atoms.

## Daily Schedule

| Day | Topic | Key Formula |
|-----|-------|-------------|
| 428 | Coulomb Problem Setup | H = p²/2μ - e²/r |
| 429 | Radial Solution | Associated Laguerre polynomials |
| 430 | Energy Spectrum | E_n = -13.6 eV/n² |
| 431 | Hydrogen Wavefunctions | ψ_{nlm} = R_{nl}Y_l^m |
| 432 | Degeneracy & Symmetry | Hidden SO(4) symmetry |
| 433 | Expectation Values | ⟨r⟩, ⟨1/r⟩, virial theorem |
| 434 | Week Review | Hydrogen atom complete |

## Key Concepts

### Energy Levels
$$E_n = -\frac{m_e e^4}{2\hbar^2 n^2} = -\frac{13.6 \text{ eV}}{n^2}$$

### Bohr Radius
$$a_0 = \frac{\hbar^2}{m_e e^2} = 0.529 \text{ Å}$$

### Degeneracy
$$g_n = 2n^2 \quad \text{(including spin)}$$

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this week, you will be able to:
1. Solve the hydrogen atom Schrödinger equation
2. Derive the Bohr formula from quantum mechanics
3. Write explicit wavefunctions for any state
4. Calculate atomic properties and expectation values
5. Explain the accidental degeneracy
6. Apply to spectroscopy and quantum computing
