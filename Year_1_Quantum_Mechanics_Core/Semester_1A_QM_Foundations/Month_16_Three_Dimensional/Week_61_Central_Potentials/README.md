# Week 61: Central Potentials & Radial Equation

## Overview
**Days 421-427** | Month 16, Week 61 | Solving 3D Quantum Problems

This week develops the general theory for quantum systems with spherically symmetric potentials, the foundation for understanding atoms.

## Daily Schedule

| Day | Topic | Key Formula |
|-----|-------|-------------|
| 421 | 3D Schrödinger Equation | ψ(r,θ,φ) = R(r)Y_l^m(θ,φ) |
| 422 | Radial Equation | -ℏ²/2m d²u/dr² + V_eff(r)u = Eu |
| 423 | Free Particle (3D) | j_l(kr), n_l(kr), h_l(kr) |
| 424 | Infinite Spherical Well | j_l(ka) = 0 |
| 425 | Finite Spherical Well | Matching conditions |
| 426 | 3D Harmonic Oscillator | E = ℏω(n + 3/2) |
| 427 | Week Review | Central potential techniques |

## Key Concepts

### Separation of Variables
$$\psi(r,\theta,\phi) = R_{nl}(r) Y_l^m(\theta,\phi)$$

### Effective Potential
$$V_{\text{eff}}(r) = V(r) + \frac{\hbar^2 l(l+1)}{2mr^2}$$

### Radial Equation (with u = rR)
$$-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\frac{d^2u}{dr^2} + V_{\text{eff}}(r)u = Eu$$

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this week, you will be able to:
1. Separate the 3D Schrödinger equation in spherical coordinates
2. Identify the centrifugal barrier term
3. Solve for spherical Bessel functions
4. Apply boundary conditions for spherical wells
5. Calculate 3D harmonic oscillator energies and degeneracies
