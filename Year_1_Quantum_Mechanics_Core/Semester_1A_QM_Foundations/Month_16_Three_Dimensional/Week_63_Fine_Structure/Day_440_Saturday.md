# Day 440: Spectroscopic Notation

## Overview
**Day 440** | Year 1, Month 16, Week 63 | Term Symbols and Selection Rules

Today we learn the standard spectroscopic notation used in atomic physics and chemistry.

---

## Learning Objectives

1. Understand term symbol notation ²S+¹L_J
2. Apply to hydrogen and multi-electron atoms
3. Derive selection rules for electric dipole transitions
4. Read energy level diagrams
5. Connect to atomic spectroscopy

## Core Content

### Term Symbol: ²S+¹L_J

- **2S+1**: Spin multiplicity (2s+1, where s = total spin)
- **L**: Total orbital angular momentum (S, P, D, F, ...)
- **J**: Total angular momentum (subscript)

### L Letter Code

| L | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Letter | S | P | D | F | G | H |

### Hydrogen Examples (s = 1/2, so 2s+1 = 2)

| State | n | l | j | Term Symbol |
|-------|---|---|---|-------------|
| Ground state | 1 | 0 | 1/2 | ²S₁/₂ |
| 2s | 2 | 0 | 1/2 | ²S₁/₂ |
| 2p | 2 | 1 | 1/2, 3/2 | ²P₁/₂, ²P₃/₂ |
| 3d | 3 | 2 | 3/2, 5/2 | ²D₃/₂, ²D₅/₂ |

### Electric Dipole Selection Rules

$$\Delta l = \pm 1$$
$$\Delta j = 0, \pm 1 \quad (j=0 \to j'=0 \text{ forbidden})$$
$$\Delta m_j = 0, \pm 1$$
$$\Delta s = 0$$

### Allowed Transitions

- ²S₁/₂ ↔ ²P₁/₂, ²P₃/₂ ✓
- ²P₃/₂ ↔ ²D₃/₂, ²D₅/₂ ✓
- ²S₁/₂ ↔ ²D₃/₂ ✗ (Δl = 2)

## Practice Problems

1. Write the term symbols for all n=3 hydrogen states.
2. Which transitions from 3D are allowed?
3. What is the parity selection rule?

---

## Summary

| Symbol | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| ²S₁/₂ | s=1/2, L=0, J=1/2 (doublet S state) |
| ²P₃/₂ | s=1/2, L=1, J=3/2 (doublet P state) |
| Selection | Δl=±1, Δj=0,±1 |
