# Week 63: Fine Structure

## Overview
**Days 435-441** | Month 16, Week 63 | Relativistic and Spin-Orbit Corrections

This week we add corrections to the hydrogen atom that break the l-degeneracy, introducing fine structure at order α² (where α ≈ 1/137).

## Daily Schedule

| Day | Topic | Key Concept |
|-----|-------|-------------|
| 435 | Relativistic Kinetic Energy | p⁴ correction |
| 436 | Spin-Orbit Coupling | L·S interaction |
| 437 | Darwin Term | Contact interaction |
| 438 | Total Fine Structure | Combined E^{(1)} |
| 439 | Good Quantum Numbers | n, l, j, m_j |
| 440 | Spectroscopic Notation | Term symbols |
| 441 | Week Review | Fine structure complete |

## Key Concepts

### Fine Structure Splitting
$$\Delta E_{\text{FS}} = E_n \frac{\alpha^2}{n^2}\left(\frac{n}{j+1/2} - \frac{3}{4}\right)$$

### Good Quantum Numbers
- j = l ± 1/2 (total angular momentum)
- States: ²S₁/₂, ²P₁/₂, ²P₃/₂, etc.
