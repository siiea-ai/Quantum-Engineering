# Week 84: Universality

## Overview
**Days 582-588** | Month 21, Week 4 | Universal Gate Sets and Compilation

This week explores the theory of universal quantum computation—which gate sets can implement any quantum operation, how to efficiently approximate arbitrary gates, and how to compile quantum algorithms to specific hardware.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this week, you will be able to:

1. **Prove** that {H, T, CNOT} forms a universal gate set
2. **Apply** the Solovay-Kitaev theorem to bound approximation overhead
3. **Characterize** the Clifford group and its limitations
4. **Explain** why T gates enable universality beyond Clifford
5. **Identify** native gate sets for different quantum hardware
6. **Compile** quantum circuits to hardware-specific gate sets

## Key Concepts

### Universal Gate Set
A gate set is **universal** if it can approximate any unitary to arbitrary precision:

$$\forall U \in SU(2^n), \forall \epsilon > 0, \exists \text{ circuit } C: ||U - C|| < \epsilon$$

### Standard Universal Sets
- {H, T, CNOT} — Fault-tolerant standard
- {H, Toffoli} — Equivalent
- {Rx, Ry, CNOT} — Continuous rotations

### Solovay-Kitaev Bound
$$\text{Gate count} = O\left(\log^c\left(\frac{1}{\epsilon}\right)\right), \quad c \approx 3.97$$

### Clifford Group
Generated by {H, S, CNOT}. Efficiently simulable classically (Gottesman-Knill theorem).

### Clifford+T
Clifford + T gate = universal but classically hard.
