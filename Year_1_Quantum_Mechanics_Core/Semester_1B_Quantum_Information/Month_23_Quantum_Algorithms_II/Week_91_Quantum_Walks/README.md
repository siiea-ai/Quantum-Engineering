# Week 91: Quantum Walks

## Overview
**Days 631-637** | Month 23, Week 3 | Quantum Walk Algorithms

This week introduces quantum walks as an alternative computational paradigm to the gate model. Quantum walks provide speedups for search and graph problems.

## Key Concepts

### Discrete-Time Walk Operator
$$U = S \cdot (C \otimes I_p)$$

where C is the coin operator and S is the conditional shift.

### Continuous-Time Walk
$$U(t) = e^{-iHt}$$

where $H = \gamma A$ (adjacency matrix).

### Quantum Walk Search
$$H = -\gamma(|s\rangle\langle s| \otimes I + |w\rangle\langle w|)$$

achieves $O(\sqrt{N})$ search on complete graph.
