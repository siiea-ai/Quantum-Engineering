# Week 78: Bell Inequalities

## Overview
**Days 540-546** | Month 20, Week 2 | Bell's Theorem and Quantum Nonlocality

This week explores Bell inequalities—the mathematical framework that distinguishes quantum correlations from classical ones and proves the impossibility of local hidden variable theories.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this week, you will be able to:

1. **Explain** the EPR paradox and Einstein's reasoning
2. **Derive** Bell and CHSH inequalities from local realism
3. **Calculate** quantum violation and Tsirelson bound
4. **Analyze** experimental loopholes and their closures
5. **Apply** Bell tests in device-independent protocols

## Key Formulas

### Local Hidden Variable Bound
$$|S_{LHV}| \leq 2$$

### CHSH Inequality
$$S = \langle AB \rangle - \langle AB' \rangle + \langle A'B \rangle + \langle A'B' \rangle$$
$$-2 \leq S \leq 2 \text{ (classical)}$$

### Tsirelson Bound
$$|S_{QM}| \leq 2\sqrt{2} \approx 2.828$$
