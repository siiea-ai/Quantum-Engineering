# Week 79: Entanglement Measures

## Overview
**Days 547-553** | Month 20, Week 3 | Quantifying Quantum Correlations

This week develops the mathematical framework for measuring and comparing entanglement, from information-theoretic entropy measures to operational quantifiers.

## Key Formulas

### Von Neumann Entropy
$$S(\rho) = -\text{Tr}(\rho \log_2 \rho) = -\sum_i \lambda_i \log_2 \lambda_i$$

### Entropy of Entanglement
$$E(|\psi\rangle) = S(\rho_A) = -\sum_i \lambda_i \log_2 \lambda_i$$

### Concurrence (Two Qubits)
$$C(\rho) = \max(0, \lambda_1 - \lambda_2 - \lambda_3 - \lambda_4)$$

### Negativity
$$\mathcal{N}(\rho) = \frac{\|\rho^{T_B}\|_1 - 1}{2}$$
