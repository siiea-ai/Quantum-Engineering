## Key Equations to Master

### Error Correction
- Knill-Laflamme: $$P_a E_i^\dagger E_j P_a = \alpha_{ij} P_a$$
- Threshold: $$p < p_{th} \Rightarrow$$ arbitrarily low logical error rate
- Magic state: $$|T\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0\rangle + e^{i\pi/4}|1\rangle)$$
- Surface code distance: $$d = \sqrt{n}$$ for $$n$$ physical qubits

### Hardware
- Transmon: $$E_J/E_C \gg 1$$ for charge noise insensitivity
- Trapped ion MS: $$U_{MS} = \exp(-i\frac{\pi}{4}\sigma_x \otimes \sigma_x)$$
- Rydberg blockade: $$U_{dd} = \frac{C_6}{r^6}$$
