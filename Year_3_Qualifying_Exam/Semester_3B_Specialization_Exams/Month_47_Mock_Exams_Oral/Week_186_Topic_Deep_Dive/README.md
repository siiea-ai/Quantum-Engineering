## The Role of the Topic Presentation

### Why This Matters

In most oral qualifying exams, you present a topic of your choice. This serves multiple purposes:

1. **Demonstrates Depth:** You show you can go beyond surface understanding
2. **Shows Research Ability:** Literature review and synthesis skills
3. **Enables Assessment:** Faculty questions probe your understanding
4. **Reveals Interests:** Indicates your research direction
5. **Provides Confidence:** You start with your strongest material

### What Faculty Look For

| Quality | Excellent | Adequate | Poor |
|---------|-----------|----------|------|
| **Understanding** | Deep, nuanced, can explain multiple perspectives | Solid grasp of main ideas | Surface-level only |
| **Organization** | Clear logical flow, excellent pacing | Reasonable structure | Disorganized or rushed |
| **Context** | Knows history, current state, open problems | Understands basic context | Isolated knowledge |
| **Technical** | Correct derivations, proper notation | Minor errors | Significant mistakes |
| **Questions** | Handles follow-ups confidently | Adequate responses | Struggles with depth |
