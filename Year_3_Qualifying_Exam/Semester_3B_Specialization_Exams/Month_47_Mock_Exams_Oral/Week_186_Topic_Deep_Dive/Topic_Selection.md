## Part 3: Topics to Avoid

### Too Narrow

- A specific technical lemma
- One paper's result without context
- Extremely specialized subfield

### Too Risky

- Topics you've only read about superficially
- Topics with recent results you haven't digested
- Topics far from your actual expertise

### Too Standard

- Basic quantum gates (unless you go very deep)
- Standard perturbation theory
- Basic entanglement (unless focusing on specific aspect)

4. **Personal angle:** Why does this interest YOU?
5. **Connections:** How does it link to other areas?

### Example: Making "Teleportation" Deep

**Surface level:** Bell measurement, classical bits, correction

**Deep level:**
