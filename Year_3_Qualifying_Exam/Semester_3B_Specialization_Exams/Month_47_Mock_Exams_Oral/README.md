## Oral Qualifying Exam Context

### Based on Real PhD Oral Qualifying Exams

This month's practice is modeled after oral qualifying examinations from leading quantum science programs:

| Institution | Oral Exam Format | Duration | Committee |
|-------------|------------------|----------|-----------|
| **MIT** | Topic presentation + broad questioning | 2 hours | 3-4 faculty |
| **Harvard QSE** | Research proposal + breadth questions | 90 minutes | 3 faculty |
| **Stanford** | 45-min presentation + 45-min questions | 90 minutes | 3 faculty |
| **Caltech** | Topic defense + general physics | 2 hours | 4-5 faculty |
| **Yale** | Oral component following written | 1 hour | 3 faculty |

Our mock exams adopt the 90-minute format with presentation and questioning phases.

### Oral Exam Structure

$$\boxed{\text{Oral Qualifying Exam} = \text{Presentation (30 min)} + \text{Questioning (60 min)}}$$

---

## The Nature of Oral Exams

### What Faculty Are Really Testing

Based on interviews with physics faculty across leading institutions:

1. **Conceptual Understanding**: Can you explain *why*, not just *how*?
2. **Physical Intuition**: Do you have a feel for the physics?
3. **Adaptability**: Can you think on your feet?
4. **Communication**: Can you explain complex ideas clearly?
5. **Research Readiness**: Are you prepared to tackle open problems?
6. **Intellectual Honesty**: Do you know what you don't know?

### The "Probing" Philosophy

Faculty questioning follows a pattern:

```
Level 1: Basic question in your area
    ↓ (correct response)
Level 2: Deeper follow-up
    ↓ (correct response)
Level 3: Connection to related topic
    ↓ (correct response)
Level 4: Edge of knowledge / Open question
    → Goal: Find where your understanding breaks down
```

This is normal and expected. The exam is designed to find your limits.

## Oral Exam Simulation Protocol

### Creating the Mock Exam Environment

To simulate a real oral exam:

1. **Physical Setup**
   - Use a real whiteboard or large paper
   - Set up video recording for self-review
   - Create a formal room arrangement
   - Dress as you would for the real exam

2. **Question Administration**
   - Use question bank with randomized selection
   - Set timer for each phase
   - Include "follow-up chains" of increasing difficulty
   - Record all questions asked and responses

3. **Post-Exam Analysis**
   - Review recording within 24 hours
   - Score using provided rubric
   - Identify patterns in weak responses
   - Create targeted remediation plan

### Solo Examination Strategy

Since you are self-studying, use these techniques:

1. **Pre-recorded Questions**
   - Record yourself asking questions (different voice/character)
   - Play back and respond in real-time
   - Simulate interruptions and follow-ups

2. **Written Response First**
   - Write out responses before speaking
   - Then explain verbally without notes
   - Compare written and verbal versions

3. **External Review**
   - Share recordings with study partners
   - Post (anonymized) to physics forums for feedback
   - Consider hiring a tutor for one session

## Key Techniques

### The "Think Aloud" Method

When facing a question:

1. **Restate**: "So you're asking about..."
2. **Organize**: "Let me think about the key components..."
3. **Explain**: Walk through your reasoning step by step
4. **Check**: "Does this answer your question?"

### Handling "I Don't Know"

Three productive responses:

1. **Partial Knowledge**: "I don't know the exact answer, but I know that..."
2. **Related Concept**: "I'm not sure about X specifically, but in related area Y..."
3. **Reasoning Approach**: "I haven't seen this before, but I would approach it by..."

Never:
- Bluff or make up answers
- Shut down completely
- Become defensive

### Whiteboard Best Practices

1. **Organization**: Divide board into sections (given, work, result)
2. **Writing**: Large, clear, horizontal equations
3. **Narration**: Explain as you write
4. **Diagrams**: Simple, labeled, referenced
5. **Cleanup**: Erase completed work to make room

## The Philosophy of Oral Exams

> "The oral exam is not primarily about finding out what you know. It's about finding out how you think."
> -- Anonymous Physics Faculty

The oral qualifying examination serves several purposes:

1. **Depth Probing**: Written exams test breadth; oral exams test depth
2. **Communication Assessment**: Can you explain physics to colleagues?
3. **Research Readiness**: Can you engage with unfamiliar problems?
4. **Character Evaluation**: How do you handle pressure and uncertainty?

Remember: The committee wants you to pass. They are testing readiness, not trying to fail you.
