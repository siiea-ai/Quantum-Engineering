## Mock Exam Administration

### Self-Administration Protocol

Since you are self-studying, use this protocol:

**Before the Exam:**
1. Clear 3 hours with no interruptions
2. Set up whiteboard/large paper
3. Set up video recording
4. Print question bank pages (sealed)
5. Prepare timer with phase markers
6. Create formal environment (dress appropriately)

**During the Exam:**

**Phase 1 (Presentation):**
1. Set timer for 30 minutes
2. Deliver your full presentation
3. At presentation end, draw 3 random questions from "Presentation Follow-up" section
4. Answer each, allow 2-3 minutes per question

**Phase 2 (Topic Questioning):**
1. Reset timer for 30 minutes
2. Draw 10 questions from your topic's section
3. Answer each in order
4. For questions you can't answer, note them and move on

**Phase 3 (Broad Questioning):**
1. Reset timer for 30 minutes
2. Draw 3 questions each from: QM, QI/QC, QEC, General Physics
3. Answer in order
4. If time remains, draw additional questions

**After the Exam:**
1. Stop recording
2. Immediately write down:
   - Questions you struggled with
   - Topics that felt weak
   - Moments of confusion or panic
   - What went well
3. Rest before reviewing recording

### Alternative: Partner Administration

If you have a study partner or can hire a tutor:

1. Give them the question bank in advance
2. Let them select questions (mixing difficulty)
3. They manage timing and phase transitions
4. They can ask follow-up questions spontaneously
5. They provide live feedback on responses

This is more realistic and highly recommended if available.

## Important Reminders

### On Exam Day

1. **Treat it seriously** - This is practice for a high-stakes exam
2. **Follow time limits** - Don't give yourself extra time
3. **Record everything** - You'll learn from reviewing it
4. **Note your feelings** - Where did anxiety spike? When did you feel confident?
5. **Be honest** - If you don't know, don't bluff

### On Feedback

1. **Be specific** - "I struggled with X" not "I need to study more"
2. **Be actionable** - Each weakness should have a remediation plan
3. **Be honest** - The point is to find weaknesses, not to feel good
4. **Be balanced** - Also note what went well

### On Remediation

1. **Prioritize ruthlessly** - You can't fix everything in 3 days
2. **Go deep** - Better to fix 2 things well than 5 things poorly
3. **Practice actively** - Don't just re-read, practice explaining
4. **Test yourself** - Use the questions you missed
