## Exam Structure

### Phase 1: Topic Presentation (30 minutes total)

**Presentation: 20-25 minutes**

Deliver your prepared presentation on your specialization topic.

**Structure:**
- Hook and motivation (2-3 min)
- Background (4-5 min)
- Core content (8-10 min)
- Implications (2-3 min)
- Summary (1-2 min)

**Rules:**
- You may use the whiteboard freely
- No notes or prepared slides
- You may briefly check the timer
- Speak as if to a committee

**Immediate Follow-Up: 5-10 minutes**

After completing your presentation, draw 3-5 questions from the "Presentation Follow-Up" section of the question bank. These are clarification and extension questions directly about your presentation.

---

### Phase 2: Topic Deep Dive (30 minutes)

**Format:** Question-and-answer on your specialization area

**Process:**
1. Draw 8-10 questions from your topic's section
2. Read each question aloud
3. Answer to the best of your ability
4. Allow 3-4 minutes per question
5. If completely stuck after 1 minute, move on (noting the gap)

**Question Types:**
- Extension questions (What if...?)
- Connection questions (How does this relate to...?)
- Derivation requests (Can you derive...?)
- Physical intuition (What's the physical meaning of...?)
- Limitations (What are the assumptions/limitations?)

**Rules:**
- You may use the whiteboard
- You may ask for clarification (once per question)
- You may not skip questions unless truly stuck
- Track which questions you struggled with

---

### Phase 3: Broad Questioning (30 minutes)

**Format:** Questions across all areas of qualifying exam preparation

**Process:**
1. Draw questions from multiple sections:
   - 3 from Quantum Mechanics
   - 3 from Quantum Information/Computing
   - 3 from Quantum Error Correction
   - 2 from General/Cross-Cutting
2. Answer in order drawn
3. Allow 2-3 minutes per question

**Question Topics:**

*Quantum Mechanics:*
- Postulates and formalism
- Angular momentum and spin
- Perturbation theory
- Scattering
- Identical particles

*Quantum Information:*
- Density matrices
- Entanglement
- Quantum channels
- Quantum algorithms

*Quantum Error Correction:*
- Stabilizer formalism
- Specific codes
- Fault tolerance
- Thresholds

*General:*
- Cross-cutting concepts
- Physical intuition
- Research connections

**Rules:**
- Same as Phase 2
- Broader topic coverage
- Tests breadth of preparation

## Time Management

### Recommended Pacing

| Phase | Duration | Checkpoints |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| **Phase 1** | 30 min | Presentation: 22 min, Follow-up: 8 min |
| **Phase 2** | 30 min | Questions 1-4: 15 min, Questions 5-8: 15 min |
| **Phase 3** | 30 min | QM: 9 min, QI: 9 min, QEC: 9 min, General: 3 min |

### Timer Settings

Set alarms:
- 22 minutes (end presentation, start follow-up)
- 30 minutes (end Phase 1)
- 60 minutes (end Phase 2)
- 85 minutes (5-minute warning)
- 90 minutes (end exam)

---

## Self-Administration Protocol

### Option A: Full Self-Administration

**Before each phase:**
1. Set timer
2. Draw questions from sealed envelope
3. Start timer

**During phase:**
1. Read question aloud
2. Begin answering (think aloud!)
3. Use whiteboard as if committee watching
4. Move to next question when done or stuck
5. Continue until timer sounds

**Between phases:**
1. Brief note of any questions you want to revisit
2. Reset timer
3. Continue immediately

**After exam:**
1. Stop recording
2. Immediate brain dump (5 min):
   - What went well?
   - What was hard?
   - What questions stumped you?
   - How did you feel at different points?
3. Rest before review

### Option B: Recorded Question Administration

**Pre-record:**
1. Record yourself reading questions in exam voice
2. Include pauses for answering
3. Include "time's up" prompts
4. Randomize question order

**During exam:**
1. Play recorded questions
2. Answer in real-time
3. Video records your performance
4. No control over timing or question selection

This is more realistic but requires advance preparation.

### Option C: Partner Administration

**If available:**
1. Give partner the question bank and rubric
2. Partner manages timing and question selection
3. Partner may ask follow-up questions
4. Partner takes notes for feedback
5. Most realistic option

*Question drawn:* "How does the decoder affect the threshold?"

*Your response:* [Discussion of decoder types and their thresholds]

*Question drawn:* "What happens above threshold?"

*Your response:* [Explanation of error accumulation and logical failure]

### Broad Questioning Example

**QM Question:** "Derive the selection rules for electric dipole transitions."

**QI Question:** "Prove that the CNOT gate generates entanglement from product states."

**QEC Question:** "What is the Knill-Laflamme condition? Give the physical interpretation."

**General:** "How does the classical limit of quantum mechanics emerge?"
