## Mock Oral Exam II: What's Different

### Compared to Mock Oral I

| Aspect | Mock Oral I | Mock Oral II |
|--------|-------------|--------------|
| Presentation time | 25-30 min | 25 min (stricter) |
| Follow-up depth | Standard | Deep probing |
| Question difficulty | Standard | Elevated |
| "I don't know" frequency | Expected | Push further |
| Recovery required | Occasional | Deliberate |
| Performance pressure | Moderate | Elevated |

### The "Harder" Elements

1. **Stricter timing** - Less flexibility in presentation phase
2. **Deeper follow-ups** - Questions chain 3-4 levels deep
3. **More unknown territory** - Deliberately push past preparation
4. **Higher expectations** - Building on Mock I foundation
5. **Stress simulation** - Closer to real exam pressure

## Mock Oral Exam II Format

### Phase 1: Presentation (25 min) + Follow-Up (10 min)

**Presentation (25 minutes STRICT):**
- Same topic as Mock I, refined based on feedback
- Timing enforced: warning at 20 min, stop at 25 min
- Expected improvements from Mock I feedback

**Follow-Up (10 minutes):**
- More challenging follow-up questions
- Questions designed to probe deeper than Mock I
- At least one question designed to reach unknown territory

### Phase 2: Topic Deep Dive with Chains (30 min)

**Format:** Questions with systematic follow-ups

**Example Chain:**
```
Q1: "Explain the surface code threshold."
   ↓ (your answer)
Q1a: "How does the decoder affect this?"
   ↓ (your answer)
Q1b: "What's the fundamental limit on decodable distance?"
   ↓ (your answer)
Q1c: "How does this relate to the MWPM matching?"
   ↓ (reaches edge of knowledge)
```

**Goal:** Systematically probe depth on 3-4 topics

### Phase 3: Broad Questioning - Elevated Difficulty (25 min)

**Format:** Harder questions from each area

- Questions from Advanced_Question_Bank.md
- More "why" questions
- More "prove that" questions
- More connection questions

---

## Materials for This Week

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `Advanced_Question_Bank.md` | Harder questions for Mock II |
| `Follow_Up_Scenarios.md` | Chains of probing questions |
| `Evaluation_Rubric.md` | Same rubric, higher expectations |
| `Performance_Analysis.md` | Comprehensive readiness assessment |

## Improvement Targets

### From Mock I to Mock II

| Dimension | Mock I Score | Target for Mock II | Improvement Goal |
|-----------|--------------|-------------------|------------------|
| Technical Accuracy | | +0.5 points | Fewer errors |
| Depth | | +0.5 points | Handle follow-ups better |
| Communication | | +0.3 points | Clearer explanations |
| Handling Unknowns | | +0.5 points | More graceful |
| Presentation | | +0.3 points | Better refined |
| **Overall** | | **4.0+ minimum** | **Clear pass** |

### Success Criteria

**Minimum for Mock II:**
- Overall score: 4.0/5.0 or higher
- No dimension below 3.5
- Demonstrated improvement from Mock I
- Graceful handling of at least 3 "unknown" moments
- Professional demeanor throughout

---

## Self-Administration Protocol (Enhanced)

### Creating Harder Conditions

1. **Stricter timing** - Use alarms, no flexibility
2. **Harder questions** - Use Advanced_Question_Bank.md
3. **Follow-up chains** - Use Follow_Up_Scenarios.md
4. **Higher standards** - Score more critically
5. **Stress simulation** - Shorter breaks, formal setup

### If Using a Partner

For Mock II especially, consider:
- Having them be more demanding
- Asking for clarification/follow-up on every answer
- Including at least one "curveball" question
- Providing real-time feedback on unclear explanations

---

## Key Differences in Questioning

### Mock II Question Characteristics

| Type | Mock I | Mock II |
|------|--------|---------|
| Surface-level | Common | Rare |
| Standard | Majority | Some |
| Challenging | Some | Majority |
| Research-level | Few | Several |
| Follow-up chains | Occasional | Systematic |

### Example Difficulty Escalation

**Mock I style:** "What is the threshold theorem?"

**Mock II style:** "Derive the threshold theorem's key implication for error suppression, then explain why constant-rate overhead is theoretically possible with QLDPC codes."

---

## Performance Comparison Framework

### Mock I vs Mock II Analysis

After Mock II, analyze:

| Metric | Mock I | Mock II | Δ | Assessment |
|--------|--------|---------|---|------------|
| Overall score | | | | |
| Presentation score | | | | |
| Topic questions average | | | | |
| Broad questions average | | | | |
| "Unknown" handling | | | | |
| Time management | | | | |
| Anxiety level | | | | |
| Confidence | | | | |

### Improvement Categories

| If Δ > 0.5 | Significant improvement |
| If 0.2 < Δ < 0.5 | Moderate improvement |
| If 0 < Δ < 0.2 | Slight improvement |
| If Δ ≤ 0 | No improvement (concerning) |

---

## Readiness Assessment

### After Mock II

**Ready for Real Exam if:**
- Mock II score ≥ 4.0
- Clear improvement from Mock I
- No critical gaps remaining
- Confident in handling unknowns
- Effective personal strategies documented

**Need More Work if:**
- Mock II score < 4.0
- No improvement from Mock I
- Critical gaps still present
- Still struggling with unknowns
- No clear strategies

### Month 48 Planning

Based on Mock II results, Month 48 should focus on:

| If Mock II Score | Month 48 Focus |
|------------------|----------------|
| 4.5+ | Light review, confidence building |
| 4.0-4.4 | Targeted gap filling |
| 3.5-3.9 | Significant remediation |
| <3.5 | Comprehensive review needed |

## The Final Push

### Remember

Mock Oral II is your final full practice before the actual exam (pending Month 48 simulation). This is where you:

1. **Prove** that Mock I preparation worked
2. **Test** your strategies under harder conditions
3. **Build** confidence for the real thing
4. **Identify** any remaining issues
5. **Document** what works for you

### Mindset

- "I am better prepared than I was for Mock I"
- "Harder questions help me grow"
- "Finding my limits now is better than finding them on exam day"
- "I can handle whatever comes"
