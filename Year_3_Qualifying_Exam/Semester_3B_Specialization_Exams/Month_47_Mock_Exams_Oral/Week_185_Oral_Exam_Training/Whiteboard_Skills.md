# Whiteboard Presentation Skills

## Mastering Visual Communication in Physics Oral Exams

---

## Introduction

The whiteboard is your primary tool during an oral exam. Your ability to use it effectively can make the difference between a clear, compelling presentation and a confusing mess. This guide covers everything from physical technique to strategic organization.

---

## Part 1: Physical Technique

### Writing Fundamentals

**Size:**
- Letters should be at least 3 inches tall for a standard whiteboard
- Equations should be clearly visible from 10 feet away
- When in doubt, write larger

**Orientation:**
- Write horizontally (not at an angle)
- Keep lines parallel to the board edges
- Maintain consistent spacing between lines

**Speed:**
- Write slower than feels natural
- The committee needs time to read and process
- Resist the urge to rush when nervous

### Body Position

**The "One-Third Rule":**
```
                    WHITEBOARD
    +------------------------------------------+
    |                                          |
    |    Writing Zone                          |
    |    (center third of board)               |
    |                                          |
    +------------------------------------------+
               |
               ▼
         +---------+
         |   You   |  ← Stand to one side
         +---------+
               |
               ▼
          Committee
```

**Key Positions:**

| Activity | Position | Body Orientation |
|----------|----------|------------------|
| Writing | At the board, to one side | Angled toward board and audience |
| Explaining | Stepped back, facing audience | 45 degrees to board |
| Pointing | Near board, turned toward audience | Profile view |
| Listening to questions | Facing committee | Away from board |

**The Cardinal Sin:** Never talk to the board with your back fully to the committee.

### Writing While Talking

**Technique 1: Write-Stop-Explain**
1. Write a complete statement or equation
2. Stop writing
3. Turn to the committee
4. Explain what you wrote
5. Turn back and write the next piece

**Technique 2: Narrate While Writing**
1. Say what you're writing as you write it
2. Periodically turn to check understanding
3. Best for simple equations or brief statements

**When to Use Each:**

| Situation | Best Technique |
|-----------|---------------|
| Complex equation | Write-Stop-Explain |
| Simple statement | Narrate While Writing |
| Key insight | Write-Stop-Explain (emphasize) |
| Routine step | Narrate While Writing |

## Part 3: Visual Elements

### Equations

**Formatting Rules:**
1. Center important equations
2. Box key results: $$\boxed{E = mc^2}$$
3. Number equations if you'll reference them
4. Leave space around operators

**Good vs. Bad:**

```
BAD:  E=mc² (cramped, hard to read)

GOOD:    E  =  m c²    (spaced, clear)
         ‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾
           (boxed)
```

### Diagrams

**Essential Elements:**
1. **Axes:** Always labeled with quantities and units
2. **Labels:** All components clearly identified
3. **Scale:** Proportions should be reasonable
4. **Arrows:** Vectors distinguished from scalars

**Diagram Checklist:**
- [ ] All axes labeled
- [ ] Key points marked
- [ ] Directions indicated with arrows
- [ ] Important features highlighted
- [ ] Legend if needed

**Common Physics Diagrams:**

1. **Energy Level Diagram**
```
     E
     |
     |    -------- E₃
     |
     |    -------- E₂
     |
     |    -------- E₁
     |
     |============ E₀ (ground state)
     +----------------
```

2. **Bloch Sphere Sketch**
```
           |z⟩
            |
            |
    ────────●──────── |y⟩
           /|
          / |
         /  |
       |x⟩
```

3. **Quantum Circuit**
```
    |0⟩ ──[H]──●────
               |
    |0⟩ ───────⊕────
```

### Using Color (if available)

| Color | Best Use |
|-------|----------|
| Black | Primary text and equations |
| Blue | Diagrams and secondary equations |
| Red | Key results, emphasis, errors to avoid |
| Green | Verified results, checkmarks |

**If only one color available:** Use different line thicknesses and boxing for emphasis.

## Part 4: Time Management on the Board

### Pacing Guidelines

| Content Type | Time to Write | Time to Explain |
|--------------|---------------|-----------------|
| Single equation | 15-30 seconds | 30-60 seconds |
| Derivation step | 30-60 seconds | 1-2 minutes |
| Diagram | 1-2 minutes | 1-2 minutes |
| Complete derivation | 5-8 minutes | Already included |

### Space Management

**The Erasure Strategy:**
- Divide the board into sections mentally
- Keep key results visible
- Erase completed intermediate work
- Never erase something you might need to reference

**What to Keep:**
- Problem statement
- Key intermediate results
- Diagrams being discussed
- Final answers

**What to Erase:**
- Routine calculations
- Corrected errors
- Completed steps no longer needed

## Part 5: Common Whiteboard Scenarios

### Scenario 1: The Derivation

**Example:** "Derive the uncertainty principle from the commutator."

**Step-by-Step:**

1. **Setup (30 seconds)**
   - Write the commutator: $$[x, p] = i\hbar$$
   - State the goal: "We want to show $$\Delta x \Delta p \geq \hbar/2$$"

2. **Key Insight (1 minute)**
   - Write: "For any state $$|\psi\rangle$$ and any operator $$A$$:"
   - Write Robertson uncertainty: $$\Delta A \Delta B \geq \frac{1}{2}|\langle[A,B]\rangle|$$

3. **Application (30 seconds)**
   - Substitute $$A = x$$, $$B = p$$
   - Get $$\Delta x \Delta p \geq \frac{1}{2}|\langle i\hbar \rangle| = \frac{\hbar}{2}$$

4. **Box Result (10 seconds)**
   - $$\boxed{\Delta x \Delta p \geq \frac{\hbar}{2}}$$

5. **Physical Interpretation (30 seconds)**
   - Turn to committee and explain the meaning

### Scenario 2: The Problem Solution

**Example:** "Find the ground state energy of a particle in a 1D box of width $$L$$."

**Layout:**
```
+------------------------+--------------------------------+
| GIVEN:                 | SOLUTION:                      |
| - Particle in box      | V = 0 inside, ∞ outside        |
| - Width L              | Schrödinger: -ℏ²/2m ψ'' = Eψ   |
| - Find E_1 (ground     | Solution: ψ = A sin(kx)        |
|   state)               | Boundary: ψ(0) = ψ(L) = 0      |
|                        | → k = nπ/L, n = 1,2,3,...      |
+------------------------+--------------------------------+
|                                                         |
| RESULT: E_n = n²π²ℏ²/(2mL²)                            |
|                                                         |
| GROUND STATE: [E₁ = π²ℏ²/(2mL²)]                       |
|                                                         |
| CHECK: E ∝ 1/L² (smaller box → higher energy) ✓         |
+--------------------------------------------------------+
```

### Scenario 3: The Conceptual Explanation

**Example:** "Explain entanglement."

**Visual Approach:**

1. **Start with diagram of separable state:**
```
   System A    System B
   |↑⟩    ⊗    |↓⟩

   "Each particle has definite state"
```

2. **Contrast with entangled state:**
```
   |Ψ⟩ = 1/√2 (|↑↓⟩ + |↓↑⟩)

   "Cannot write as product"
   "Measuring A instantly determines B"
```

3. **Key properties (bullet points):**
   - Non-local correlations
   - Cannot be explained classically
   - Resource for quantum computing/communication

### Scenario 4: The Recovery

**When you make a mistake:**

1. **Don't erase immediately** - explain what went wrong
2. **Draw a clear line through the error**
3. **Write the correction nearby**
4. **Mark clearly:** "Correction: ..."

**Example:**
```
   E = ℏω(n + 1)  ← CROSSED OUT
         ↓
   Correction: E = ℏω(n + 1/2)  ← CIRCLED
```

## Part 6: Practice Exercises

### Exercise 1: Basic Equation Writing

Write these equations clearly on a whiteboard:

1. Schrodinger equation: $$i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial t}|\psi\rangle = \hat{H}|\psi\rangle$$

2. Density matrix definition: $$\rho = \sum_i p_i |\psi_i\rangle\langle\psi_i|$$

3. von Neumann entropy: $$S(\rho) = -\text{Tr}(\rho \log_2 \rho)$$

4. Stabilizer condition: $$g|\psi\rangle = |\psi\rangle$$ for all $$g \in S$$

5. Grover diffusion: $$D = 2|s\rangle\langle s| - I$$

**Goal:** Each equation should be readable from 10 feet, written in under 30 seconds.

### Exercise 2: Derivation Practice

Complete these derivations on the whiteboard with proper organization:

1. **Harmonic oscillator energy levels using ladder operators**
   - Time limit: 8 minutes
   - Must include: Definition of a, a†, commutator, action on states

2. **No-cloning theorem proof**
   - Time limit: 5 minutes
   - Must include: Assumption, linearity argument, contradiction

3. **Teleportation protocol**
   - Time limit: 6 minutes
   - Must include: Initial state, Bell measurement, corrections

### Exercise 3: Diagram Skills

Draw these diagrams clearly and quickly:

1. Energy levels of hydrogen (first 4 levels with fine structure)
2. Bloch sphere with a specific state vector
3. Surface code layout (5x5)
4. Quantum circuit for Grover iteration
5. Phase space trajectory for harmonic oscillator

**Goal:** Each diagram in under 2 minutes with all labels.

### Exercise 4: Complete Presentation (20 minutes)

Record yourself and review for:
- Board organization
- Writing clarity
- Explanation quality
- Time management
- Body positioning

## Part 7: Common Mistakes and Fixes

### Mistake 1: Cramped Writing

**Problem:** Equations squeezed together, hard to read
**Fix:** Use at least twice as much space as feels natural

### Mistake 2: Talking to the Board

**Problem:** Explaining while facing the board
**Fix:** Write-Stop-Turn-Explain

### Mistake 3: Blocking the Board

**Problem:** Standing in front of what you just wrote
**Fix:** Step to the side after writing

### Mistake 4: Random Organization

**Problem:** Writing wherever there's space
**Fix:** Plan your layout before starting

### Mistake 5: No Intermediate Results

**Problem:** Giant derivations with no waypoints
**Fix:** Box or underline key intermediate steps

### Mistake 6: Messy Diagrams

**Problem:** Diagrams that don't convey information
**Fix:** Practice standard physics diagrams repeatedly

### Mistake 7: Silent Writing

**Problem:** Long periods of writing without speaking
**Fix:** Either narrate or use write-stop-explain

### Mistake 8: No Cleanup

**Problem:** Board becomes cluttered mess
**Fix:** Erase strategically, keep only what's needed

---

## Part 8: Quick Reference

### Before Starting

1. Check you have working markers
2. Plan your layout mentally
3. Position yourself appropriately
4. Make eye contact with committee

### While Presenting

1. Write large and clear
2. Speak while writing or write-stop-explain
3. Stand to the side
4. Turn to face committee when explaining
5. Keep key results visible
6. Erase completed intermediate work

### Key Rules

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| Write large | Write small |
| Face audience while explaining | Talk to the board |
| Box key results | Let important equations get erased |
| Use space efficiently | Cram everything together |
| Narrate your work | Write in silence |
| Step aside after writing | Block your work |

---

## Part 9: Equipment Considerations

### Markers/Chalk

- **Test before starting** - make sure they work
- **Have backups** - markers die at the worst times
- **Check colors** - ensure contrast with board

### Whiteboard vs. Chalkboard

| Whiteboard | Chalkboard |
|------------|------------|
| Easier to erase | More tactile feedback |
| Can have color | Usually limited to white/colored chalk |
| Can glare under lights | Usually matte |
| Markers can dry out | Chalk always works |

### Digital Boards/Tablets

If available:
- Practice before the exam
- Know how to undo/erase
- Be aware of lag
- Have backup (regular board)
