# Handling Unknown Questions

## The Art of Productive Uncertainty in Physics Oral Exams

---

## Introduction

Every oral exam will include questions you cannot fully answer. This is by design. Faculty probe until they find the boundaries of your knowledge. Your goal is not to avoid this moment, but to handle it with grace, intelligence, and intellectual honesty.

This guide provides strategies for turning "I don't know" from a failure into a demonstration of scientific maturity.

## Part 1: Why Unknown Questions Are Inevitable

### The Faculty Perspective

Common perspectives from physics qualifying exam committees:

> "I always push until students reach the edge of their knowledge. If I never find that edge, I haven't done my job." - Common faculty perspective

> "The students who impress me most are those who can reason productively even when they're clearly at the limit of what they know." - Common faculty perspective

> "I can teach someone facts. I can't teach intellectual honesty. The oral exam is partly to assess that." - Common faculty perspective

### The Question Hierarchy

Faculty typically follow a pattern:

```
Level 1: Core Knowledge
├── Questions every PhD student should know
└── Expected: Confident, complete answers

Level 2: Advanced Understanding
├── Deeper aspects of core topics
└── Expected: Good answers, maybe some gaps

Level 3: Connections and Extensions
├── Links between topics, broader implications
└── Expected: Partial knowledge, good reasoning

Level 4: Research Frontier
├── Open questions, cutting-edge topics
└── Expected: Awareness, ability to reason

Level 5: Beyond
├── Questions designed to find your limits
└── Expected: Honest acknowledgment, productive response
```

**Key Insight:** Reaching Level 5 is normal and expected. Your response at this level matters more than getting there.

## Part 2: Types of "Unknown" Situations

### Type 1: Complete Blank

**Situation:** You have no knowledge of the topic
**Example:** "Describe the AdS/CFT correspondence."

**Signs:**
- Never heard the term before
- No related knowledge to draw on
- Nothing comes to mind

### Type 2: Vague Familiarity

**Situation:** You've heard of it but can't explain it
**Example:** "Explain topological order."

**Signs:**
- Recognize the term
- Remember it's important for some reason
- Can't recall specifics

### Type 3: Partial Knowledge

**Situation:** You know some aspects but not others
**Example:** "Derive the Lamb shift."

**Signs:**
- Understand the concept generally
- Know it involves some specific techniques
- Can't execute the full derivation

### Type 4: Forgotten Details

**Situation:** You learned this but can't recall it now
**Example:** "What's the explicit form of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for adding j=1 to j=1/2?"

**Signs:**
- Definitely studied this
- Understand the concept
- Specific formula won't come

### Type 5: Unexpected Angle

**Situation:** You know the topic but not from this perspective
**Example:** "How does decoherence relate to the measurement problem?"

**Signs:**
- Know both topics separately
- Haven't thought about this specific connection
- Need to reason it out

## Part 3: Response Frameworks

### Framework 1: The Honest Acknowledgment with Value-Add

**Structure:**
1. Acknowledge the gap clearly
2. Provide related knowledge
3. Reason about what you don't know
4. Offer to engage further

**Template:**
> "I'm not familiar with [specific topic], but I can share what I know about [related area]. Based on that, I would expect [reasoned inference]. Is there a connection I should be making?"

**Example - Complete Blank:**

*Question:* "Describe the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis."

*Response:*
> "I haven't studied the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis directly. I know it relates to how isolated quantum systems reach thermal equilibrium, which I understand in the context of statistical mechanics. Based on my knowledge of quantum thermodynamics, I would expect it involves how individual energy eigenstates can contain thermal information. Is it related to the Berry conjecture about chaotic systems?"

### Framework 2: Reasoning from First Principles

**Structure:**
1. Acknowledge you haven't seen this before
2. Identify fundamental principles that apply
3. Work through the reasoning step by step
4. Arrive at a best guess

**Template:**
> "I haven't encountered this specific problem, but let me work from first principles. We know that [fundamental fact]. This implies [logical consequence]. So I would expect [conclusion], though I'm not certain."

**Example - Unexpected Question:**

*Question:* "What happens to entanglement at finite temperature?"

*Response:*
> "I haven't specifically studied finite-temperature entanglement, but let me reason through it. At finite temperature, systems are described by thermal density matrices rather than pure states. The thermal state is $$\rho = e^{-\beta H}/Z$$, which is mixed. Since entanglement requires pure state properties, I would expect thermal fluctuations to decrease entanglement. At high enough temperature, the state would approach the maximally mixed state, which has no entanglement. So thermal noise should monotonically decrease entanglement, with some critical temperature above which it vanishes completely. Is this the concept of 'entanglement sudden death'?"

### Framework 3: The Partial Knowledge Response

**Structure:**
1. State what you do know confidently
2. Acknowledge the specific gap
3. Explain why the gap exists (if appropriate)
4. Offer what you can

**Template:**
> "I can tell you about [known aspect]. Regarding [unknown aspect], I've seen it mentioned but never worked through it in detail. What I can say is [limited knowledge]."

**Example - Vague Familiarity:**

*Question:* "Explain quantum error correction using cat codes."

*Response:*
> "I know that cat codes are a bosonic error correction scheme using superpositions of coherent states. The basic idea is that coherent states $$|\alpha\rangle$$ and $$|-\alpha\rangle$$ are approximately orthogonal for large $$\alpha$$, so their superpositions can encode a qubit. I understand they're particularly good for protecting against photon loss errors. However, I haven't worked through the error correction procedure specifically - how syndrome extraction works for cat codes. My understanding is that parity measurements play a key role. Could you tell me if I'm on the right track?"

### Framework 4: The Limiting Case Approach

**Structure:**
1. Acknowledge the full question is beyond your knowledge
2. Find a limiting case you can analyze
3. Solve the limiting case
4. Speculate about generalization

**Template:**
> "I can't solve the general case you're asking about, but let me try a limiting case. When [parameter] → [limit], this reduces to [simpler problem] which I can analyze. [Solve it.] The general case would presumably interpolate, though I don't know the exact form."

**Example - Partial Knowledge:**

*Question:* "Calculate the correction to the hydrogen ground state energy from QED."

*Response:*
> "I can't do the full QED calculation, but let me set up what I can. The leading QED correction comes from the electron self-energy and vacuum polarization. Dimensionally, these corrections should be of order $$\alpha^3 m_e c^2$$ since they're one loop higher than the Coulomb calculation. The actual result involves the Lamb shift, which is about 1 GHz for the 2S state. I know the calculation requires renormalization and careful handling of divergences, which I haven't fully worked through. The key physics is that virtual photons dress the electron, effectively smearing its position over a length scale $$\sim \alpha \cdot a_0$$."

### Framework 5: The Honest Redirect

**Structure:**
1. Acknowledge you can't answer
2. Explain where your knowledge does lie
3. Offer a related question you could answer
4. Stay engaged

**Template:**
> "I don't know enough about [topic] to give a good answer. My preparation focused more on [related area]. I could discuss [related topic] if that would be helpful, or I'm happy to hear more about [original topic] - I'd learn something."

**Example:**

*Question:* "How do you implement a non-Abelian anyon braiding experimentally?"

*Response:*
> "I don't have detailed knowledge of the experimental implementation. I understand the theory - that Majorana fermions at the ends of topological superconductor wires could be non-Abelian anyons, and that braiding them would implement topologically protected gates. But the actual experimental techniques - how you move the anyons and read out the result - I haven't studied in detail. I'm more familiar with the superconducting qubit experimental setup if that would be useful. Or I'm happy to hear about the experimental challenges - it's a topic I've wanted to understand better."

## Part 4: What NOT to Do

### Never Bluff

**Why It's Bad:**
- Faculty can almost always tell
- Damages credibility for things you DO know
- Demonstrates poor judgment

**Signs of Bluffing:**
- Using vague, impressive-sounding words
- Avoiding specifics
- Hoping they won't follow up

**Example of Bluffing (DON'T DO THIS):**
> "Oh yes, the AdS/CFT correspondence... it's about the relationship between gravity and quantum field theory. Very deep stuff. Maldacena showed that strings and gauge theories are related in a holographic way."

*This sounds like you might know something but contains zero actual content.*

### Never Shut Down

**Why It's Bad:**
- Shows inability to engage
- Misses opportunity to demonstrate reasoning
- Leaves bad impression

**What Shutting Down Looks Like:**
- "I don't know."
- Long silence
- "I never learned that."
- Visible distress without recovery

### Never Get Defensive

**Why It's Bad:**
- Makes the committee uncomfortable
- Suggests inability to handle criticism
- Not the temperament for research

**Defensive Responses (DON'T DO THIS):**
- "That wasn't in any of my textbooks."
- "We didn't cover that in class."
- "I don't think that's fair to ask."
- "Can we move to something else?"

### Never Over-Apologize

**Why It's Bad:**
- Wastes time
- Doesn't add information
- Makes everyone uncomfortable

**Over-Apologizing (DON'T DO THIS):**
> "I'm so sorry, I really should know this. I can't believe I don't know this. This is embarrassing. I apologize - I know I should have studied this more..."

**Better:**
> "I don't have a good answer for that. Let me tell you what I do know..."

---

## Part 5: Psychological Preparation

### Reframing the Unknown

**Old Mindset:** "Unknown questions mean I failed."

**New Mindset:** "Unknown questions are opportunities to demonstrate reasoning."

**Affirmations:**
- "The committee expects to find my limits."
- "How I handle uncertainty matters more than avoiding it."
- "Reasoning through the unknown is a research skill."

### Managing the Emotional Response

**When You Don't Know:**
1. **Notice** the anxiety (it's normal)
2. **Breathe** - one slow breath
3. **Reframe** - this is expected
4. **Engage** - start with what you DO know

### Building Tolerance for Uncertainty

**Practice Exercise:**
Have someone ask you questions you can't answer. Practice:
1. Staying calm
2. Acknowledging the gap
3. Providing related knowledge
4. Reasoning productively

## Part 6: Practice Questions with Model Responses

### Question Set 1: Complete Unknowns

**Q1:** "Explain the Unruh effect."

**Model Response:**
> "I'm not sure about the Unruh effect specifically. I know it's related to how observers perceive vacuums differently depending on their acceleration - a concept that connects quantum field theory and general relativity. The name suggests it's named after Unruh. I would guess it's related to Hawking radiation, since both involve non-inertial frames and vacuum perception. Is it the statement that accelerating observers see thermal radiation where inertial observers see vacuum?"

**Q2:** "What is a strange attractor?"

**Model Response:**
> "I haven't studied strange attractors in depth. I know they come from nonlinear dynamics and chaos theory. An attractor is a set toward which a dynamical system evolves. I would guess 'strange' means it has fractal structure or unusual dimensionality. The Lorenz attractor is an example I've heard of. In quantum mechanics, I'm not sure how this connects - maybe to quantum chaos? Could you tell me more about the context you're interested in?"

### Question Set 2: Partial Knowledge

**Q3:** "Derive the scattering matrix for a delta function potential."

**Model Response:**
> "Let me work through what I can. For a delta potential $$V(x) = \lambda\delta(x)$$, I need to match wave functions across the delta. To the left, I have $$\psi = Ae^{ikx} + Be^{-ikx}$$ (incident + reflected). To the right, $$\psi = Ce^{ikx}$$ (transmitted). The matching conditions are: continuity of $$\psi$$ at $$x=0$$, and the derivative has a discontinuity proportional to $$\lambda$$. From $$\psi(0^+) = \psi(0^-)$$: $$A + B = C$$. The derivative condition is... actually, I'd need to integrate the Schrodinger equation around $$x=0$$ to get the exact form. I know the result should give reflection and transmission coefficients that depend on $$\lambda/k$$. Let me try: $$\psi'(0^+) - \psi'(0^-) = (2m\lambda/\hbar^2)\psi(0)$$. So $$ikC - ik(A-B) = (2m\lambda/\hbar^2)C$$. Combined with $$A+B=C$$, I can solve for $$r = B/A$$ and $$t = C/A$$..."

**Q4:** "Explain the connection between tensor networks and quantum error correction."

**Model Response:**
> "I know both topics but haven't deeply studied their connection. Let me reason through it. Tensor networks like MPS and PEPS represent quantum states with limited entanglement efficiently. Error correcting codes protect quantum information using redundancy, which requires entanglement. The connection might be that the structure of good codes can be represented as tensor networks. I also recall that holographic codes have some MERA-like structure, connecting to AdS/CFT. For surface codes specifically, the state structure is local, which tensor networks handle well. So I'd guess tensor networks provide an efficient way to represent and manipulate error-corrected states, though I don't know the precise formal relationship."

### Question Set 3: Unexpected Angles

**Q5:** "How would you experimentally distinguish between Copenhagen and many-worlds interpretations?"

**Model Response:**
> "This is a philosophically charged question! Let me think about it physically. The interpretations give identical predictions for all observations - that's what makes it interpretation rather than physics. So in principle, you can't distinguish them experimentally... but let me think harder. If many-worlds is right, there might be subtle interference effects if 'branches' could recohere, but decoherence prevents this in practice. Some proposals involve testing quantum mechanics at larger scales - if collapse happened at some scale, that would favor Copenhagen. Recent experiments on superposition of larger and larger objects (like the Fröhlich proposals) probe this. But honestly, I think most physicists believe they're empirically equivalent. Am I missing something about what you're asking?"

**Q6:** "What would happen if the fine structure constant were twice as large?"

**Model Response:**
> "Interesting question. Let me work through the effects. The fine structure constant $$\alpha \approx 1/137$$ sets the strength of electromagnetic interactions. If $$\alpha$$ doubled to about 1/70, atoms would be smaller since the Bohr radius $$a_0 \propto 1/\alpha$$. Binding energies would increase as $$\alpha^2$$. For chemistry, this would completely change reaction rates and molecular structures. Nuclei might also be affected since Coulomb repulsion competes with nuclear forces - heavier elements might not be stable. I've heard arguments that even small changes to $$\alpha$$ would make carbon-based life impossible - some anthropic reasoning. At $$\alpha \sim 1$$, QED would be strongly coupled and perturbation theory would fail entirely. Is there a specific aspect you're interested in?"

## Part 7: Recovery Strategies

### After You've Admitted Not Knowing

**Don't:**
- Dwell on the failure
- Apologize repeatedly
- Let it affect subsequent questions

**Do:**
- Accept it and move on
- Perform well on the next question
- Maintain confidence

### If You Later Remember

**If in the same question:**
> "Actually, I just remembered - the key point is..."

**If on a later question:**
> "I realized earlier when you asked about X, the answer is actually... I apologize for not getting that immediately."

*Only do this if genuinely useful; don't interrupt flow unnecessarily.*

### After Multiple Unknown Questions

If you're struggling with a whole line of questioning:
> "I'm clearly at the edge of my preparation in this area. [Topic] is something I need to study more deeply. Could we explore a different aspect, or would you like me to continue reasoning through these questions?"

This shows self-awareness without giving up.
