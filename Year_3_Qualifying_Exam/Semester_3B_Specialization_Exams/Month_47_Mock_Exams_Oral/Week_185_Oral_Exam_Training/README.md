## Core Skills to Develop

### 1. The "Framework" Response

When asked any question, use this structure:

```
1. ACKNOWLEDGE: "That's asking about [topic]."
2. CONTEXT: "This is important because..."
3. CORE CONCEPT: "The key idea is..."
4. DETAILS: "Specifically, [derivation/explanation]..."
5. CONNECTION: "This relates to [broader topic]..."
6. CHECK: "Does that address what you were asking?"
```

### 2. Whiteboard Organization

Standard board layout:

```
+------------------+------------------+------------------+
|    GIVEN         |     WORK         |     RESULT       |
|  - Problem       |  - Step 1        |  - Final answer  |
|  - Known values  |  - Step 2        |  - Key insight   |
|  - Assumptions   |  - Step 3        |  - Check/verify  |
+------------------+------------------+------------------+
|            DIAGRAMS / FIGURES (as needed)             |
+-------------------------------------------------------+
```

### 3. Time Management

For a 5-minute explanation:

| Phase | Time | Content |
|-------|------|---------|
| Setup | 30 sec | State the topic and its importance |
| Core | 2.5 min | Main concepts and key equations |
| Details | 1.5 min | One worked example or derivation |
| Wrap-up | 30 sec | Summary and connections |

### 4. Recovery Techniques

When you make a mistake:

1. **Catch it yourself**: "Wait, let me reconsider that..."
2. **Stay calm**: Don't apologize excessively
3. **Correct clearly**: State the correct version
4. **Move forward**: Don't dwell

- [ ] Did I practice handling at least one "unknown" question?

### End of Week

- [ ] Can I explain 10+ topics in under 5 minutes each?
- [ ] Am I comfortable with whiteboard work?
- [ ] Do I have strategies for unknown questions?
- [ ] Have I identified my personal strengths/weaknesses?
- [ ] Am I ready for the topic deep dive?

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### 1. The "Brain Dump"
**Problem:** Saying everything you know without organization
**Solution:** Use the framework, stay focused on what's asked

### 2. The "Apology Loop"
**Problem:** Excessive apologizing for mistakes
**Solution:** Correct and move forward confidently

### 3. The "Frozen Deer"
**Problem:** Shutting down when facing unknown questions
**Solution:** Practice productive uncertainty responses

### 4. The "Speed Run"
**Problem:** Talking too fast, skipping explanations
**Solution:** Slow down, explain as if to a smart colleague

### 5. The "Back to the Board"
**Problem:** Talking to the board instead of the committee
**Solution:** Write, then turn and explain
