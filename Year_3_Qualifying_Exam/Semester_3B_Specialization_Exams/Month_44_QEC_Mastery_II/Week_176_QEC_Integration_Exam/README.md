## Key Formulas Reference

### Threshold Theorem
$$p^{(L)} = p_{\text{th}} \left(\frac{p}{p_{\text{th}}}\right)^{2^L}$$

### Magic State Distillation
$$\epsilon_{\text{out}} = 35\epsilon_{\text{in}}^3 \quad \text{(15-to-1)}$$

### Distillation Overhead
$$N = O\left(\log^{\gamma}(1/\epsilon)\right), \quad \gamma = \log_3(15) \approx 2.46$$

### QLDPC Parameters (Panteleev-Kalachev)
$$[[n, k = \Theta(n), d = \Theta(n)]]$$

### Decoder Thresholds
$$p_{\text{th}}^{\text{MWPM}} \approx 10.3\%, \quad p_{\text{th}}^{\text{UF}} \approx 9.9\%$$
