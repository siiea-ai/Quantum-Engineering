# Week 189: Gap Remediation

## Overview

**Days:** 1317-1323 (7 days)
**Theme:** Systematic correction of weaknesses identified in mock examinations
**Objective:** Transform identified gaps into areas of strength before the final mock exam

---

## The Strategic Approach

Gap remediation is not random review. It is a targeted, data-driven process:

```
Mock Exam Performance Analysis
            ↓
    Gap Identification
            ↓
    Priority Ranking
            ↓
    Targeted Study Plan
            ↓
    Problem Practice
            ↓
    Reassessment
            ↓
    Iteration
```

This week focuses exclusively on your weakest areas as identified in Months 46-47 mock examinations.

## Assessment Rubric

### Gap Severity Levels

| Level | Description | Required Action |
|-------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Critical (5)** | Cannot attempt problems | Deep re-learning required |
| **Severe (4)** | Major errors, incomplete solutions | Significant review + practice |
| **Moderate (3)** | Minor errors, slow solving | Targeted practice |
| **Minor (2)** | Occasional mistakes | Light review + few problems |
| **Negligible (1)** | Rare errors | Maintenance only |

### Progress Targets

| Gap Level | Target After Week |
|-----------|-------------------|
| 5 → 3 | Critical to moderate |
| 4 → 2 | Severe to minor |
| 3 → 1 | Moderate to negligible |
| 2 → 1 | Minor to negligible |
| 1 → 1 | Maintain excellence |

## Key Equations for Review

### Perturbation Theory

$$E_n^{(1)} = \langle n^{(0)}|H'|n^{(0)}\rangle$$

$$E_n^{(2)} = \sum_{m \neq n} \frac{|\langle m^{(0)}|H'|n^{(0)}\rangle|^2}{E_n^{(0)} - E_m^{(0)}}$$

$$|n^{(1)}\rangle = \sum_{m \neq n} \frac{\langle m^{(0)}|H'|n^{(0)}\rangle}{E_n^{(0)} - E_m^{(0)}} |m^{(0)}\rangle$$

### Angular Momentum Coupling

$$|j_1, j_2, j, m\rangle = \sum_{m_1, m_2} C_{j_1 m_1, j_2 m_2}^{j m} |j_1, m_1\rangle |j_2, m_2\rangle$$

$$|j_1 - j_2| \leq j \leq j_1 + j_2$$

### Information Theory

$$S(\rho) = -\text{Tr}(\rho \log_2 \rho)$$

$$I(A:B) = S(\rho_A) + S(\rho_B) - S(\rho_{AB})$$

$$\chi = S(\rho) - \sum_i p_i S(\rho_i)$$

### Error Correction

$$\text{Syndrome: } s = He^T$$

$$p_L \approx \binom{d}{t+1} p^{t+1} \quad \text{where } t = \lfloor(d-1)/2\rfloor$$

## Motivation

> *"Every gap closed is a potential exam question you'll now answer correctly. Every weakness addressed is confidence gained for the final examination."*

This week is about focused, intentional improvement. You have identified your weaknesses through rigorous mock examination. Now you systematically convert them to strengths.

**Remember:** The goal is not perfection in all areas. The goal is sufficient competency across all domains and excellence in your specialization. Prioritize accordingly.

**Week Duration:** 7 days
**Daily Study Time:** ~9 hours
**Total Week Hours:** ~55 hours
**Focus:** Weakness elimination
