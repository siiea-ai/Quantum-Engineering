## Overview

**Days:** 1324-1330 (7 days)
**Theme:** Transition from student to researcher through proposal development
**Objective:** Develop initial research direction, literature review skills, and draft proposal

---

## The Research Transition

This week marks a fundamental shift in your trajectory. For three years, you have been learning established knowledge. Now you begin the process of identifying how you will contribute *new* knowledge to the field.

```
Year 0-2: Absorbing Knowledge
Year 3: Demonstrating Mastery
Year 4+: Creating Knowledge  ← You are preparing for this
```

The research proposal is not just an academic exercise. It represents:
- Your first attempt at original scientific thinking
- A roadmap for the next 2-3 years of your career
- Evidence of research readiness for your qualifying committee
