## Comparison to Subject Exams

### Expected Progression

| Exam | Expected Score | Actual |
|------|----------------|--------|
| QM (Week 181) | 160+ | ___ |
| QI/QC (Week 182) | 160+ | ___ |
| QEC (Week 183) | 160+ | ___ |
| Comprehensive | 160+ | ___ |

### Integration Challenge

The comprehensive exam is harder than individual exams because:
1. Longer duration requires stamina
2. Must switch between topic areas
3. Problems may combine concepts from multiple areas
4. Research-level problems test true understanding
