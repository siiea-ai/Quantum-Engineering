## Exam-Taking Strategies

### Time Allocation

For a 3-hour exam with 8 problems:

$$\text{Average time per problem} = \frac{180 \text{ min}}{8} = 22.5 \text{ min}$$

Recommended allocation:
- First pass (read all problems): 10 min
- Work "easy" problems first: 60-90 min
- Tackle harder problems: 60-90 min
- Review and check: 15-20 min

### Problem-Solving Protocol

1. **Read the problem completely** before writing anything
2. **Identify the physics** - what concepts are being tested?
3. **Write down relevant equations** - even if not sure how to proceed
4. **Set up the problem** - draw diagrams, define coordinates
5. **Execute the mathematics** - show all steps clearly
6. **Check your answer** - units, limiting cases, physical reasonableness

### Partial Credit Maximization

| Action | Typical Credit |
|--------|---------------|
| Correctly identifying the physics | 10-20% |
| Writing relevant starting equations | 15-25% |
| Setting up the problem correctly | 20-30% |
| Partial mathematical progress | 10-20% |
| Final correct answer | 10-20% |

## Success Criteria

### Passing Thresholds

| Score | Interpretation | Action Required |
|-------|---------------|-----------------|
| 180-200 (90-100%) | Pass with Distinction | Minimal review needed |
| 160-179 (80-89%) | Pass | Address minor gaps |
| 140-159 (70-79%) | Conditional Pass | Significant remediation |
| <140 (<70%) | Did Not Pass | Major review required |

### Self-Assessment Questions

After the exam, honestly answer:
1. Did I manage my time effectively?
2. Which topics felt strongest? Weakest?
3. Were my errors conceptual or computational?
4. Did I show sufficient work for partial credit?
5. What would I do differently next time?

## Key Formulas to Know

### Fundamentals

$$[\hat{x}, \hat{p}] = i\hbar \quad \Rightarrow \quad \Delta x \Delta p \geq \frac{\hbar}{2}$$

$$\langle A \rangle = \langle \psi | \hat{A} | \psi \rangle = \text{Tr}(\rho \hat{A})$$

### Harmonic Oscillator

$$\hat{a} = \sqrt{\frac{m\omega}{2\hbar}}\left(\hat{x} + \frac{i\hat{p}}{m\omega}\right), \quad E_n = \hbar\omega\left(n + \frac{1}{2}\right)$$

### Angular Momentum

$$[\hat{J}_i, \hat{J}_j] = i\hbar\epsilon_{ijk}\hat{J}_k$$

$$\hat{J}^2 |j,m\rangle = \hbar^2 j(j+1) |j,m\rangle, \quad \hat{J}_z |j,m\rangle = \hbar m |j,m\rangle$$

$$\hat{J}_\pm |j,m\rangle = \hbar\sqrt{j(j+1) - m(m\pm 1)} |j,m\pm 1\rangle$$

### Perturbation Theory

$$E_n^{(1)} = \langle n^{(0)} | \hat{V} | n^{(0)} \rangle$$

$$E_n^{(2)} = \sum_{k \neq n} \frac{|\langle k^{(0)} | \hat{V} | n^{(0)} \rangle|^2}{E_n^{(0)} - E_k^{(0)}}$$

$$|n^{(1)}\rangle = \sum_{k \neq n} \frac{\langle k^{(0)} | \hat{V} | n^{(0)} \rangle}{E_n^{(0)} - E_k^{(0)}} |k^{(0)}\rangle$$
