## Qualifying Exam Context

### Based on Real PhD Qualifying Exams

This month's exams are modeled after qualifying examinations from leading physics programs:

| Institution | Written Exam Format | Topics |
|-------------|---------------------|--------|
| **MIT** | Part I: 5 hours, 20 short problems; Part II: 5 hours, 8 problems (choose 4) | QM, E&M, StatMech, CM |
| **Harvard** | Two 3-hour sessions | QM, E&M, StatMech, CM |
| **Yale** | 3-hour written + oral component | Breadth across core physics |
| **Caltech** | Written + oral candidacy exam | Core physics + specialization |

Our exams adapt this format for quantum science and engineering specialization.

### Exam Structure

$$\boxed{\text{Written Qualifying Exam} = \text{Core Physics} + \text{QI/QC} + \text{QEC}}$$

## Exam Philosophy

### Principles of Qualifying Exams

1. **Breadth over depth**: Tests comprehensive knowledge across the field
2. **Problem-solving ability**: Can you apply concepts, not just recall them?
3. **Physical intuition**: Do you understand why, not just how?
4. **Research readiness**: Can you tackle unfamiliar problems?

### Time Management Strategy

$$\text{Time per problem} = \frac{\text{Total time}}{\text{Number of problems}} \times 0.8$$

Reserve 20% for review and difficult problems.

### Partial Credit Maximization

Based on grading practices at major institutions:

| Component | Typical Weight |
|-----------|---------------|
| Setting up the problem correctly | 20-30% |
| Identifying correct approach | 15-25% |
| Mathematical execution | 30-40% |
| Final answer with units | 10-20% |

---

## Assessment Rubrics

### Grading Scale

| Grade | Percentage | Interpretation |
|-------|------------|----------------|
| **Pass with Distinction** | 90-100% | Exceptional, research-ready |
| **Pass** | 80-89% | Solid understanding, minor gaps |
| **Conditional Pass** | 70-79% | Significant gaps, remediation needed |
| **Fail** | <70% | Major gaps, repeat exam |

### Self-Assessment Protocol

After each exam:
1. Grade your solutions against the rubric
2. Identify conceptual vs. computational errors
3. Note time management issues
4. Document knowledge gaps
5. Create remediation plan

## Key Formulas to Have Memorized

### Quantum Mechanics

$$i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial t}|\psi\rangle = \hat{H}|\psi\rangle$$

$$E_n^{(1)} = \langle n^{(0)}|\hat{V}|n^{(0)}\rangle$$

$$[\hat{L}_i, \hat{L}_j] = i\hbar\epsilon_{ijk}\hat{L}_k$$

### Quantum Information

$$S(\rho) = -\text{Tr}(\rho \log_2 \rho)$$

$$F(\rho, \sigma) = \left(\text{Tr}\sqrt{\sqrt{\rho}\sigma\sqrt{\rho}}\right)^2$$

$$\mathcal{E}(\rho) = \sum_k K_k \rho K_k^\dagger$$

### Quantum Error Correction

$$P_a E_i^\dagger E_j P_a = \alpha_{ij} P_a$$

$$p_L \sim \left(\frac{p}{p_{th}}\right)^{\lceil d/2 \rceil}$$
