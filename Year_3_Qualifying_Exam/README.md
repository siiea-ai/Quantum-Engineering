## Philosophy: The Qualifying Exam Transition

### What Makes Year 3 Different

| Years 0-2 | Year 3 |
|-----------|--------|
| Learn new material daily | Review and deepen existing material |
| Sequential topic coverage | Cross-cutting integration |
| Theory + problems + labs | Problems + oral practice + writing |
| Building knowledge | Demonstrating mastery |
| Consumption | Production |

### The PhD Qualifying Exam

The qualifying examination tests whether a student has:

1. **Mastery** of foundational material (not just familiarity)
2. **Synthesis** ability (connecting disparate topics)
3. **Research potential** (ability to think independently)
4. **Scientific communication** (explaining complex ideas clearly)

Based on Harvard QSE and MIT Physics guidelines:
- **Oral examination** format (90-120 minutes)
- **General knowledge + specialized topic**
- Tests **reasoning and scientific discourse**, not just recall

## Year 3 Content Structure

### Different from Years 0-2

Year 3 does **not** use daily lesson files. Instead, each week contains:

```
Week_XXX_Topic/
├── README.md                    # Week overview and objectives
├── Review_Guide.md              # Comprehensive topic review
├── Problem_Set.md               # 20-30 qualifying exam problems
├── Problem_Solutions.md         # Detailed solutions
├── Oral_Practice.md             # Oral exam practice questions
└── Self_Assessment.md           # Progress tracking
```

### Weekly Schedule

| Block | Time | Duration | Activity |
|-------|------|----------|----------|
| Morning | 9:00 AM - 12:00 PM | 3 hours | Problem solving (exam-style) |
| Afternoon | 2:00 PM - 5:00 PM | 3 hours | Topic review, derivations, oral practice |
| Evening | 7:00 PM - 8:30 PM | 1.5 hours | Written practice, flash cards |

**Weekly Total:** 7.5 hours/day × 6 days = 45 hours
**Focus:** 60% problems, 25% review, 15% oral practice

---

## Assessment Structure

### Monthly Assessments

Each month ends with a comprehensive assessment:
- **Written exam** (3 hours, exam-style problems)
- **Oral component** (30 minutes, topic explanation)
- **Gap analysis** (identify areas needing work)

### Mock Qualifying Exams (Months 46-47)

Full-length exam simulations:
- Written: 4-hour comprehensive exam
- Oral: 90-minute faculty-style questioning
- Graded against real qualifying exam standards
