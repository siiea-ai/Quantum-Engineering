## Exam Day Protocols

### Written Exam (Day 1086)
1. Start at a fixed time (e.g., 9:00 AM)
2. No references except a formula sheet you prepare
3. Strictly timed (3 hours)
4. Simulate exam conditions (quiet, focused)
5. Do NOT check answers until finished

### Oral Practice (Days 1088-1089)
1. Have a study partner ask questions randomly
2. Or record yourself answering
3. Limit thinking time to ~30 seconds before starting
4. Practice board work (diagrams, equations)

3. Identify patterns in mistakes

### Remediation (Days 1090-1091)
1. Focus on weakest topics
2. Re-do similar problems
3. Practice oral explanations of weak areas

### Planning (Day 1092)
1. Document remaining gaps
2. Create study plan for continued review
3. Prepare for Month 40 (QI/QC Theory)

## Mindset

**This is practice, not judgment.**

The purpose of this exam is to:
- Identify what you know well
- Find areas needing more work
- Build exam-taking stamina
- Practice under pressure

Even if results are disappointing, use them constructively to improve.
