## Tips for Success

1. **Start broad, then focus:** Give an overview before diving into details
2. **Draw pictures:** Sketches help explain and buy thinking time
3. **State assumptions:** Make clear what you're assuming
4. **Check limits:** Verify answers make sense in limiting cases
5. **Connect to physics:** Relate math to physical phenomena
6. **Admit uncertainty:** Better to say "I'm not sure" than bluff
