## Month Structure

### Week 153: Identical Particles (Days 1065-1071)

The quantum mechanical treatment of identical particles represents a fundamental departure from classical mechanics. This week covers:

- **Permutation symmetry** and the exchange operator
- **Bosons and fermions** - fundamental classification of particles
- **Spin-statistics theorem** - connection between spin and exchange symmetry
- **Slater determinants** for fermionic wavefunctions
- **Second quantization** - creation/annihilation operators
- **Helium atom** - two-electron system as paradigmatic example

$$\Psi(1,2) = \pm\Psi(2,1) \quad \text{(+ for bosons, - for fermions)}$$

### Week 154: Variational & WKB Methods (Days 1072-1078)

Approximation methods are essential tools when exact solutions are unavailable:

- **Variational principle**: For any trial wavefunction $|\tilde{\psi}\rangle$
$$E_0 \leq \frac{\langle\tilde{\psi}|H|\tilde{\psi}\rangle}{\langle\tilde{\psi}|\tilde{\psi}\rangle}$$

- **Trial wavefunctions** with adjustable parameters
- **Born-Oppenheimer approximation** for molecules
- **WKB approximation** - semiclassical limit
$$\psi(x) \approx \frac{C}{\sqrt{p(x)}}\exp\left(\pm\frac{i}{\hbar}\int p(x)dx\right)$$
- **Connection formulas** at classical turning points
- **Tunneling rates** and alpha decay

### Week 155: Scattering Theory (Days 1079-1085)

Scattering experiments probe the fundamental interactions of nature:

- **Scattering amplitude** $f(\theta,\phi)$ and cross sections
$$\frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega} = |f(\theta,\phi)|^2$$

- **Partial wave expansion** and phase shifts $\delta_\ell$
$$f(\theta) = \sum_{\ell=0}^{\infty}(2\ell+1)P_\ell(\cos\theta)\frac{e^{i\delta_\ell}\sin\delta_\ell}{k}$$

- **Born approximation** for weak scattering
$$f^{(1)}(\mathbf{q}) = -\frac{m}{2\pi\hbar^2}\int V(\mathbf{r})e^{-i\mathbf{q}\cdot\mathbf{r}}d^3r$$

- **Optical theorem** connecting forward scattering to total cross section
- **Resonances** and Breit-Wigner formula

### Week 156: QM Integration Exam (Days 1086-1092)

Comprehensive assessment of quantum mechanics mastery:

- **Day 1-2**: Full written practice exam (3 hours)
- **Day 3-4**: Oral exam practice with common questions
- **Day 5-6**: Gap identification and targeted review
- **Day 7**: Performance analysis and improvement planning
