# Week 147: One-Dimensional Systems

## Overview

Week 147 focuses on the canonical 1D quantum systems that appear on virtually every physics qualifying exam. These systems—the infinite and finite square well, the harmonic oscillator, and delta function potentials—are the workhorses of quantum mechanics. Mastery of these problems is essential for PhD qualification.

**Days:** 1023-1029
**Total Study Time:** ~50 hours
**Focus:** Square wells, harmonic oscillator, delta potentials, wave packets

## Core Concepts

### 1. Infinite Square Well
- Boundary conditions and quantization
- Energy levels: $$E_n = \frac{n^2\pi^2\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$$
- Wavefunctions: $$\psi_n = \sqrt{\frac{2}{L}}\sin\frac{n\pi x}{L}$$
- Orthonormality and completeness

### 2. Finite Square Well
- Matching conditions at boundaries
- Transcendental equations for energies

- Energy levels: $$E_n = \hbar\omega(n + 1/2)$$
- Ground state Gaussian

### 4. Harmonic Oscillator (Algebraic)
- Ladder operators $$\hat{a}$$, $$\hat{a}^\dagger$$
- Number operator $$\hat{n} = \hat{a}^\dagger\hat{a}$$
- Matrix elements
- Coherent states

### 5. Delta Function Potential
- Bound state for attractive delta
- Scattering for all delta potentials
- Reflection and transmission coefficients

## Key Equations

### Infinite Well
$$E_n = \frac{n^2\pi^2\hbar^2}{2mL^2}, \quad n = 1, 2, 3, ...$$

$$\psi_n(x) = \sqrt{\frac{2}{L}}\sin\left(\frac{n\pi x}{L}\right)$$

### Harmonic Oscillator
$$E_n = \hbar\omega\left(n + \frac{1}{2}\right)$$

$$\hat{a} = \sqrt{\frac{m\omega}{2\hbar}}\hat{x} + \frac{i\hat{p}}{\sqrt{2m\omega\hbar}}$$

$$\hat{a}|n\rangle = \sqrt{n}|n-1\rangle, \quad \hat{a}^\dagger|n\rangle = \sqrt{n+1}|n+1\rangle$$

### Delta Potential
$$V(x) = -\alpha\delta(x) \Rightarrow E_0 = -\frac{m\alpha^2}{2\hbar^2}$$
