# Week 148: Tunneling and Month Integration

## Overview

Week 148 concludes Month 37 with a focus on quantum tunneling—one of the most striking demonstrations of quantum behavior—and integrates all topics covered this month. The WKB approximation provides powerful semiclassical methods for barrier penetration and bound state problems. This week culminates in a practice qualifying exam covering all Month 37 material.

**Days:** 1030-1036
**Total Study Time:** ~50 hours
**Focus:** Tunneling, WKB approximation, month synthesis, practice exam

3. Derive and apply the WKB approximation
4. Use WKB connection formulas at turning points
5. Apply WKB to tunneling rate calculations
6. Integrate all Month 37 topics for exam readiness
7. Complete a full practice qualifying exam

## Key Equations

### Step Potential ($$E > V_0$$)
$$R = \left|\frac{k_1 - k_2}{k_1 + k_2}\right|^2, \quad T = \frac{4k_1k_2}{(k_1 + k_2)^2}$$

### Rectangular Barrier Tunneling
$$T \approx e^{-2\gamma}, \quad \gamma = \int_{x_1}^{x_2}\kappa(x)\,dx$$

### WKB Approximation
$$\psi(x) \approx \frac{C}{\sqrt{p(x)}}\exp\left[\pm\frac{i}{\hbar}\int p(x)\,dx\right]$$

### WKB Quantization
$$\oint p\,dx = 2\pi\hbar\left(n + \frac{1}{2}\right)$$
