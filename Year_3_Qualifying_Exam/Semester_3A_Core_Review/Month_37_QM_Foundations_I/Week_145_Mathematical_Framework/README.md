# Week 145: Mathematical Framework of Quantum Mechanics

## Overview

Week 145 launches the qualifying exam preparation with an intensive review of the mathematical foundations of quantum mechanics. This material forms the bedrock of all quantum physics and is tested extensively on PhD qualifying exams. Mastery of Dirac notation, operator algebra, and the uncertainty principle is essential for success.

**Days:** 1009-1015
**Total Study Time:** ~50 hours
**Focus:** Hilbert spaces, operators, eigenvalue problems, commutators, uncertainty

## Key Equations

### Inner Products and Norms
$$\langle \psi | \psi \rangle = \|\psi\|^2 \geq 0$$

$$\langle \phi | \psi \rangle = \langle \psi | \phi \rangle^*$$

### Operator Properties
$$\hat{A}^\dagger = \hat{A} \quad \text{(Hermitian)}$$

$$\hat{U}^\dagger \hat{U} = \hat{U} \hat{U}^\dagger = \hat{1} \quad \text{(Unitary)}$$

$$\hat{P}^2 = \hat{P} = \hat{P}^\dagger \quad \text{(Projection)}$$

### Canonical Commutation Relations
$$[\hat{x}, \hat{p}] = i\hbar$$

$$[\hat{L}_i, \hat{L}_j] = i\hbar \epsilon_{ijk} \hat{L}_k$$

### Generalized Uncertainty Principle
$$\Delta A \Delta B \geq \frac{1}{2}|\langle [\hat{A}, \hat{B}] \rangle|$$

## Study Tips for This Week

1. **Master Dirac notation** — It's the language of quantum mechanics
2. **Practice operator algebra** — Work through many examples
3. **Memorize key commutators** — $$[\hat{x}, \hat{p}]$$, $$[\hat{L}_i, \hat{L}_j]$$, $$[\hat{a}, \hat{a}^\dagger]$$
4. **Derive, don't memorize** — Understand where formulas come from
5. **Check Hermiticity often** — Observable operators must be Hermitian

---

## Common Exam Mistakes to Avoid

1. Forgetting that $$\langle\phi|\hat{A}|\psi\rangle^* = \langle\psi|\hat{A}^\dagger|\phi\rangle$$
2. Confusing Hermitian conjugate with complex conjugate
3. Misapplying completeness relations
4. Errors in commutator algebra (signs, ordering)
5. Incorrectly stating the uncertainty principle (missing factor of 1/2)
