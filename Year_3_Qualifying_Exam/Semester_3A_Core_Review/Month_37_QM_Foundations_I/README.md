# Month 37: Quantum Mechanics Foundations Review I

## Overview

This month marks the beginning of Year 3: Qualifying Examination Preparation. Month 37 focuses on comprehensive review of core quantum mechanics concepts—the material that forms the foundation of every physics PhD qualifying exam. This intensive review covers the mathematical framework of quantum mechanics, measurement theory, dynamics, and one-dimensional systems.

**Duration:** 4 weeks (28 days)
**Days:** 1009-1036
**Weeks:** 145-148
**Total Study Time:** ~200 hours
**Focus:** PhD Qualifying Exam Preparation

---

## Purpose and Philosophy

The qualifying examination tests not just your knowledge, but your ability to:

1. **Solve problems under pressure** — Timed exam conditions require efficient problem-solving strategies
2. **Explain concepts clearly** — Oral exams demand articulate, physicist-level explanations
3. **Connect different topics** — Deep understanding reveals interconnections
4. **Recognize problem types** — Pattern recognition accelerates solution finding
5. **Handle edge cases** — Examiners probe boundary conditions and limiting cases

This month emphasizes active problem-solving over passive reading. Every concept is reinforced through qualifying-exam-level problems drawn from MIT, Caltech, Yale, Berkeley, and other top programs.

## Month Learning Objectives

By the end of Month 37, you will be able to:

1. Articulate all postulates of quantum mechanics and their mathematical foundations
2. Solve eigenvalue problems for arbitrary operators in Dirac notation
3. Derive and apply the generalized uncertainty principle
4. Calculate time evolution using multiple methods (Schrödinger, Heisenberg, propagators)
5. Solve all standard 1D problems (wells, barriers, oscillator) with confidence
6. Apply WKB approximation to tunneling and bound state problems
7. Pass a practice qualifying exam on QM foundations with 80%+ score

## Key Formulas Reference Card

### Mathematical Framework
$$\langle \psi | \phi \rangle = \int \psi^*(x) \phi(x)\, dx$$

$$\hat{A}^\dagger = (\hat{A}^T)^* \quad \text{(Hermitian conjugate)}$$

$$\sum_n |n\rangle\langle n| = \hat{1} \quad \text{(completeness)}$$

### Dynamics
$$K(x,t;x',0) = \langle x | e^{-i\hat{H}t/\hbar} | x' \rangle$$

$$\psi(x,t) = \int K(x,t;x',0) \psi(x',0)\, dx'$$

### 1D Systems
$$\psi_n(x) = \sqrt{\frac{2}{L}}\sin\left(\frac{n\pi x}{L}\right) \quad \text{(infinite well)}$$

$$\hat{a}^\dagger \hat{a} = \hat{n}, \quad [\hat{a}, \hat{a}^\dagger] = 1$$
