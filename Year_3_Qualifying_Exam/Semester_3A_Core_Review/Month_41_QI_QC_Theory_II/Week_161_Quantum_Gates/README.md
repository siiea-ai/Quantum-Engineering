# Week 161: Quantum Gates

## Single-Qubit Gates, Two-Qubit Gates, and Universality

**Days:** 1121-1127
**Theme:** Comprehensive mastery of quantum gate theory and universal computation

---

## Week Overview

This week provides deep review of quantum gate theory, from the mathematical foundations of single-qubit rotations through the proof of universal computation. The material is essential for qualifying examinations, where students must demonstrate both computational fluency with gate operations and theoretical understanding of universality and the Solovay-Kitaev theorem.

### Core Learning Objectives

By the end of this week, you will be able to:

1. Express any single-qubit gate as a rotation on the Bloch sphere
2. Decompose arbitrary single-qubit unitaries using ZYZ or ZXZ conventions
3. Characterize two-qubit gates using entangling power and local equivalence
4. Prove that Clifford+T (or H+T+CNOT) forms a universal gate set
5. State and apply the Solovay-Kitaev theorem for gate approximation
6. Synthesize unitaries from finite gate sets with optimal gate count

**Key Topics:**
- Pauli matrices as generators of SU(2)
- Bloch sphere parametrization of pure states
- Rotation operators: $R_x(\theta)$, $R_y(\theta)$, $R_z(\theta)$
- Physical interpretation of rotations

**Essential Formulas:**
$$R_{\hat{n}}(\theta) = e^{-i\theta\hat{n}\cdot\vec{\sigma}/2} = \cos\frac{\theta}{2}I - i\sin\frac{\theta}{2}(\hat{n}\cdot\vec{\sigma})$$

### Day 1122 (Tuesday): Single-Qubit Gates II
**Focus:** Euler decompositions and gate synthesis

**Key Topics:**
- ZYZ decomposition: $U = e^{i\alpha}R_z(\beta)R_y(\gamma)R_z(\delta)$
- Alternative decompositions: ZXZ, XYX
- Relationship between SU(2) and SO(3)
- Global phase considerations

**Key Skill:** Given any $2\times 2$ unitary matrix, express it in ZYZ form

### Day 1123 (Wednesday): Two-Qubit Gates I
**Focus:** CNOT, controlled operations, entanglement generation

**Key Topics:**
- CNOT gate matrix and action on computational basis
- Controlled-U gates for arbitrary U
- Creating Bell states with CNOT
- Entangling power quantification

**Essential Formula:**
$$\text{CNOT} = |0\rangle\langle 0| \otimes I + |1\rangle\langle 1| \otimes X = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix}$$

### Day 1124 (Thursday): Two-Qubit Gates II
**Focus:** SWAP gates, iSWAP, Cartan decomposition

**Key Topics:**
- SWAP and $\sqrt{\text{SWAP}}$ gates
- iSWAP and fSim gates (superconducting qubits)
- KAK (Cartan) decomposition of two-qubit unitaries
- Local equivalence classes

**Essential Formula:**
$$U = (A_1 \otimes A_2) \cdot e^{i(c_1 XX + c_2 YY + c_3 ZZ)} \cdot (B_1 \otimes B_2)$$

### Day 1125 (Friday): Universal Gate Sets
**Focus:** Proving universality

**Key Topics:**
- Definition of universality (exact vs. approximate)
- Proving {H, T, CNOT} is universal
- Clifford group and magic states
- Native gate sets on different hardware platforms

**Key Theorem:** Any finite gate set generating a dense subgroup of SU($2^n$) is computationally universal.

### Day 1126 (Saturday): Solovay-Kitaev Theorem
**Focus:** Efficient approximation of arbitrary unitaries

**Key Topics:**
- Statement of Solovay-Kitaev theorem
- Proof outline and key lemmas
- Algorithm description and complexity $O(\log^{3.97}(1/\epsilon))$
- Comparison with optimal gate synthesis

**Theorem Statement:**
If $\mathcal{G}$ generates a dense subgroup of SU(2), then any $U \in \text{SU}(2)$ can be $\epsilon$-approximated by $O(\log^c(1/\epsilon))$ gates from $\mathcal{G}$.

### Day 1127 (Sunday): Gate Synthesis & Week Review
**Focus:** Optimal synthesis techniques, comprehensive review

**Key Topics:**
- T-count and T-depth optimization
- Clifford+T synthesis algorithms
- Review of all week's material
- Practice problems and self-assessment

## Key Concepts Summary

### The Pauli Matrices
$$X = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix}, \quad Y = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix}, \quad Z = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{pmatrix}$$

### Standard Single-Qubit Gates
$$H = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\ 1 & -1 \end{pmatrix}, \quad S = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & i \end{pmatrix}, \quad T = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & e^{i\pi/4} \end{pmatrix}$$

### Rotation Gates
$$R_x(\theta) = \begin{pmatrix} \cos\frac{\theta}{2} & -i\sin\frac{\theta}{2} \\ -i\sin\frac{\theta}{2} & \cos\frac{\theta}{2} \end{pmatrix}$$

$$R_y(\theta) = \begin{pmatrix} \cos\frac{\theta}{2} & -\sin\frac{\theta}{2} \\ \sin\frac{\theta}{2} & \cos\frac{\theta}{2} \end{pmatrix}$$

$$R_z(\theta) = \begin{pmatrix} e^{-i\theta/2} & 0 \\ 0 & e^{i\theta/2} \end{pmatrix}$$
