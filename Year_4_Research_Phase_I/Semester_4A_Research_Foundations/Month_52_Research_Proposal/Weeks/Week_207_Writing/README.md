## Key Concepts

### Writing for Reviewers

**Your readers are:**
- Experts in your broad field (not your exact specialty)
- Reading 10-15 proposals in a short time
- Looking for reasons to rank you highly
- Also looking for weaknesses to justify concerns

**Write to:**
- Make key points immediately clear
- Provide enough detail for specialists
- Include enough context for non-specialists
- Be compelling without overselling

### The Narrative Arc

```
HOOK: Why should anyone care?
    ↓
PROBLEM: What don't we understand?
    ↓
APPROACH: How will you solve it?
    ↓
PLAN: What specifically will you do?
    ↓
VALIDATION: How will you know it worked?
    ↓
IMPACT: What changes if you succeed?
```

### Writing Quality Indicators

| Quality | How to Achieve |
|---------|----------------|
| Clear | Short sentences, active voice, defined terms |
| Specific | Numbers, names, parameters instead of vague words |
| Organized | Clear sections, logical flow, signposting |
| Compelling | Strong opening, clear significance, confident tone |
| Complete | All required sections, no gaps in logic |

## Common Writing Problems

### Problem: Too Technical

**Before:** "We implement the ADAPT-VQE algorithm with UCCSD operator pool using Trotterized evolution and COBYLA optimization."

**After:** "We will use an adaptive quantum algorithm that automatically selects the most important quantum operations for each molecule, reducing circuit depth compared to standard approaches. Specifically, we implement ADAPT-VQE with a chemically-motivated operator pool, enabling efficient optimization on near-term hardware."

### Problem: Too Vague

**Before:** "We will develop new quantum algorithms."

**After:** "We will develop variational quantum algorithms that achieve chemical accuracy (<1 kcal/mol) for molecules up to 30 qubits, targeting a 10x reduction in circuit depth compared to standard UCCSD."

### Problem: Passive Voice

**Before:** "The codes will be optimized and validated."

**After:** "We will optimize the codes using genetic algorithms and validate them on IBM Quantum hardware."

### Problem: Weak Opening

**Before:** "Quantum computing is an important field."

**After:** "Quantum computers promise to solve problems in chemistry, optimization, and cryptography that are intractable for classical machines, but current devices remain fundamentally limited by errors."

## Self-Check Questions

After this week, you should be able to answer:

1. Does my Project Summary capture the essence of my proposal?
2. Does my Specific Aims page follow the formula?
3. Is my Background appropriate in depth and scope?
4. Does my Research Plan have sufficient detail?
5. Are my Broader Impacts specific and substantive?
6. Is my timeline realistic with clear milestones?

---

## Looking Ahead

Next week (Week 208) focuses on **Refinement and Review**:
- Self-review using agency rubrics
- Incorporating peer feedback
- Polishing language and formatting
- Final submission preparation

Your draft from this week is the foundation. Week 208 is about making it excellent.

*"Writing is rewriting. The first draft is just getting your ideas on paper. The magic happens in revision."*
