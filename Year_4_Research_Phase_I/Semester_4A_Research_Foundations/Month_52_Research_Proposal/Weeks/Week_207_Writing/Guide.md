# Guide: Writing the Research Proposal

## Introduction

Writing a proposal is different from writing a paper. A paper reports what you did; a proposal sells what you will do. This guide provides strategies for writing compelling, clear, and complete research proposals.

---

## Part 1: The Writer's Mindset

### Proposals as Persuasion

A proposal is a persuasive document. You are asking reviewers to recommend that significant resources be allocated to your idea. Your writing must:

1. **Capture attention** - Hook readers immediately
2. **Establish credibility** - Show you understand the field
3. **Create urgency** - Explain why this matters now
4. **Build confidence** - Demonstrate you can deliver
5. **Inspire excitement** - Make reviewers want this to happen

### Know Your Audience

**Primary readers (reviewers):**
- 3-5 scientists in your broad area
- Mix of specialists and generalists
- Reading 10-15 proposals in a few days
- Looking for excellence AND weaknesses

**Secondary readers (program officers):**
- Less technical expertise than reviewers
- Focus on portfolio fit and impact
- Make final funding decisions

**Write for both:** Technical enough for specialists, accessible enough for generalists.

### The Proposal Contract

When reviewers recommend funding, they're entering a contract:
- "We believe this research will produce [outcomes]"
- "We believe this team can deliver"
- "We believe this is worth the investment"

Your writing must make each of these beliefs credible.

## Part 2: Structure and Flow

### The Proposal Architecture

```
PROJECT SUMMARY (1 page)
├── Overview: What you'll do
├── Intellectual Merit: Why it advances knowledge
└── Broader Impacts: Why society benefits

SPECIFIC AIMS (1 page)
├── Hook: Why this matters
├── Gap: What we don't know
├── Solution: Your approach
├── Aims: What specifically you'll do
└── Impact: What changes if you succeed

BACKGROUND (2-3 pages)
├── Field overview
├── State of the art
├── The gap
├── Your innovation
└── Significance

RESEARCH PLAN (6-8 pages)
├── Aim 1 (2-3 pages)
├── Aim 2 (2-3 pages)
├── Aim 3 (2-3 pages)
└── Timeline

BROADER IMPACTS (1-1.5 pages)
├── Training
├── Broadening participation
├── Educational integration
├── Dissemination
└── Societal benefit
```

### Information Flow

Each section should flow naturally to the next:

```
Summary → Creates interest → "I want to know more"
    ↓
Aims → Defines scope → "Here's what they'll do"
    ↓
Background → Establishes need → "I understand why"
    ↓
Plan → Details approach → "I see how"
    ↓
Impacts → Promises value → "This is worthwhile"
```

### The "Tell Them Three Times" Rule

1. **Tell them what you'll tell them** - Summary/Aims (overview)
2. **Tell them** - Background/Plan (details)
3. **Tell them what you told them** - Conclusion/Impact (synthesis)

---

## Part 3: Writing the Project Summary

### The One-Page Elevator Pitch

The Project Summary is often read first and may be the only thing some reviewers read carefully. It must:
- Stand alone (no jargon requiring explanation)
- Cover all key points
- Be compelling but precise
- Fit exactly three paragraphs on one page

### Structure

**Overview (~150 words):**
```
Sentence 1: Big picture importance
Sentence 2: Specific problem/opportunity
Sentence 3: Your approach
Sentence 4: Expected outcomes
Sentence 5: Timeline/scope
```

**Intellectual Merit (~100 words):**
```
Sentence 1: How this advances knowledge
Sentence 2: Innovation/novelty
Sentence 3: Key scientific contributions
Sentence 4: Why you're positioned to succeed
```

**Broader Impacts (~100 words):**
```
Sentence 1: Training/workforce development
Sentence 2: Broadening participation
Sentence 3: Educational components
Sentence 4: Societal benefits
```

### Writing Tips

**Do:**
- Use third person ("The project will..." not "We will...")
- Be specific (numbers, targets, methods)
- Include your central hypothesis
- Make each paragraph independent

**Don't:**
- Use first person
- Include citations
- Use undefined acronyms
- Exceed one page

### Example

> **Overview:** Quantum computers promise transformative capabilities for chemistry, optimization, and cryptography, but remain fundamentally limited by hardware errors. This project develops new quantum error correction codes optimized for the biased noise characteristics of superconducting quantum processors, targeting a 5-fold reduction in the physical qubit overhead required for fault-tolerant computation. The research combines theoretical code design with numerical simulation and experimental validation on cloud-accessible quantum hardware. Over three years, this work will produce optimized codes, trained decoders, and the first experimental demonstration of biased-noise error correction advantage.
>
> **Intellectual Merit:** This research advances quantum error correction by moving beyond symmetric noise assumptions that poorly match real hardware. The project will establish new theoretical bounds on achievable performance for asymmetric codes, develop machine learning-based decoders that exploit noise structure, and provide the first experimental validation of tailored codes on commercial quantum systems. The combination of theory, computation, and experiment creates a comprehensive framework for practical fault-tolerant quantum computing.
>
> **Broader Impacts:** This project trains two PhD students and four undergraduate researchers in quantum computing, with active recruitment from underrepresented groups through established partnerships with minority-serving institutions. All developed codes and software will be released open-source, accelerating progress across the quantum computing community. The PI will develop new graduate course materials on practical error correction and deliver annual public lectures at local science museums, broadening public understanding of quantum technology.

## Part 4: Writing the Specific Aims Page

### The Most Important Page

The Specific Aims page determines whether reviewers engage with the rest of your proposal. If they're not convinced here, they'll read the rest looking for confirmation of their doubts.

### The Formula

```
PARAGRAPH 1: THE HOOK (4-5 sentences)
├── Big picture: Why does this field matter?
├── Progress: What has been achieved?
├── Problem: What challenge remains?
└── Transition: Your opportunity

PARAGRAPH 2: THE GAP (4-5 sentences)
├── Knowledge gap: What don't we know?
├── Previous attempts: What has been tried?
├── Limitations: Why those approaches fall short
└── What's needed: The missing piece

PARAGRAPH 3: YOUR SOLUTION (3-4 sentences)
├── Central hypothesis
├── Approach overview
├── Why you can succeed
└── Transition to aims

THE AIMS (1-2 sentences each)
├── Aim 1: [Action verb] [specific objective]
├── Aim 2: [Action verb] [specific objective]
├── Aim 3: [Action verb] [specific objective]
└── (Optional) Aim 4: [Action verb] [specific objective]

PARAGRAPH 4: IMPACT (2-3 sentences)
├── Expected outcomes
├── Field advancement
└── Broader implications
```

### Strong Aims

Aims should be:
- **Specific:** Exactly what you'll do
- **Measurable:** Clear success criteria
- **Achievable:** Feasible within timeline
- **Relevant:** Clearly connected to hypothesis
- **Time-bound:** Implicitly or explicitly

**Action verbs for aims:**
- Develop, Design, Create (for new things)
- Characterize, Determine, Identify (for understanding)
- Validate, Demonstrate, Establish (for proof)
- Optimize, Improve, Enhance (for better performance)

**Weak aim:** "We will study quantum error correction."

**Strong aim:** "Develop asymmetric stabilizer codes achieving 3x reduction in qubit overhead for noise bias ratios exceeding 10."

### Independence and Connections

Aims should be:
- **Connected** enough that they form a coherent project
- **Independent** enough that failure of one doesn't doom others

**Pitfall:** If Aim 2 completely depends on Aim 1, and Aim 1 might fail, your proposal is high-risk.

**Solution:** Design aims that can produce valuable results even if other aims face problems.

## Part 5: Writing the Background

### Purpose

The Background section establishes:
1. Your understanding of the field
2. The importance of the problem
3. Why current solutions are insufficient
4. How your approach is innovative
5. The significance of success

### Structure

**Section 1: Field Overview (1 paragraph)**
- Broad importance of the research area
- Key advances in the past 5-10 years
- Current state of the art

**Section 2: Current Approaches (1-2 paragraphs)**
- What methods exist
- What they've achieved
- Their limitations

**Section 3: The Gap (1 paragraph)**
- What remains unsolved
- Why this is important
- What's needed to move forward

**Section 4: Your Approach (1 paragraph)**
- How you address the gap
- What's novel about your approach
- Preliminary evidence (if any)

**Section 5: Significance (1 paragraph)**
- What changes if you succeed
- Impact on field and society

### Citation Strategy

- Cite 30-50 papers (typical)
- Be generous to prior work
- Include recent papers (shows currency)
- Include classics (shows depth)
- Cite relevant work by likely reviewers

### Tone

- Authoritative but not arrogant
- Critical but fair
- Confident but not overreaching

**Weak:** "Previous work has completely failed to address this problem."

**Strong:** "While previous approaches have advanced our understanding of X, they face fundamental limitations in Y that prevent application to Z."

## Part 6: Writing the Research Plan

### The Heart of the Proposal

This is where you demonstrate you can do the work. It must be:
- Specific enough to be reproducible
- Justified enough to be convincing
- Feasible enough to be achievable
- Flexible enough to handle problems

### Structure for Each Aim

```
AIM X: [Title]

X.1 Rationale (1 paragraph)
    Why this aim is necessary
    Connection to overall objective

X.2 Approach (2-4 paragraphs)
    Detailed methodology
    Specific protocols and parameters
    Expected results at each step

X.3 Expected Outcomes (1 paragraph)
    What you'll learn/produce
    How this enables subsequent work

X.4 Potential Pitfalls and Alternatives (1-2 paragraphs)
    What could go wrong
    How you'll address it
    Backup plans
```

### Writing Methodology

**Be specific:**
- Name exact tools (software versions, equipment models)
- State parameters (sample sizes, tolerances, thresholds)
- Describe protocols step-by-step

**Be justified:**
- Explain why this method over alternatives
- Reference precedent (cite papers using this approach)
- Connect to your expertise

**Be validated:**
- Describe how you'll verify methods work
- Include controls and benchmarks
- State success criteria

### Balancing Detail

**Too little detail:**
> "We will use machine learning to analyze the data."

**Too much detail:**
> "We will instantiate a TensorFlow 2.4.1 session using the Adam optimizer with default beta1=0.9, beta2=0.999, epsilon=1e-7, learning_rate=0.001..."

**Just right:**
> "We will train a 5-layer convolutional neural network (architecture: 32-64-128-64-32 filters) using Adam optimization with learning rate 10^-4, targeting >99% classification accuracy on held-out validation data."

## Part 7: Creating Visual Elements

### Figures in Proposals

Figures can:
- Communicate complex ideas quickly
- Break up dense text
- Demonstrate preliminary data
- Show project structure

### Types of Figures

1. **Schematic/conceptual:** Overview of approach
2. **Data figures:** Preliminary results
3. **Diagrams:** Experimental setup, workflow
4. **Timeline:** Gantt chart
5. **Tables:** Comparison of methods, parameters

### Figure Design Principles

- **Readable:** 10+ point fonts, clear labels
- **Self-contained:** Caption explains figure
- **Referenced:** Cited in text
- **Professional:** Consistent style, clean design
- **Printable:** Works in black and white

### Gantt Charts

Essential elements:
- Tasks grouped by aim
- Time scale (months or quarters)
- Milestones marked
- Dependencies shown
- Parallel activities visible

```
GANTT CHART EXAMPLE

              Year 1              Year 2              Year 3
Task         Q1  Q2  Q3  Q4  Q1  Q2  Q3  Q4  Q1  Q2  Q3  Q4
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Aim 1
 Task 1.1   ████
 Task 1.2       ████████
 Task 1.3           ████████
                        ◆ M1

Aim 2
 Task 2.1               ████████
 Task 2.2                   ████████████
 Task 2.3                           ████████
                                        ◆ M2

                                                        ◆ M3

Publications      ◇           ◇               ◇           ◇

◆ = Major Milestone  ◇ = Publication
```

### Figure Captions

Captions should be complete enough to understand the figure without reading the text:

**Weak:** "Figure 1: Results."

**Strong:** "Figure 1: Logical error rate versus physical error rate for standard surface codes (blue) and our tailored codes (red) at bias ratio η=10. Tailored codes achieve 3x lower logical error rate at p=0.005, demonstrating the advantage of bias-aware design."

## Part 8: Writing Broader Impacts

### NSF's Requirements

Broader Impacts is weighted equally with Intellectual Merit at NSF. Don't treat it as an afterthought.

### Categories to Address

1. **Training and Workforce Development**
   - Graduate students (number, focus, outcomes)
   - Undergraduate researchers (REU, academic year)
   - Postdoctoral mentoring
   - Skills development

2. **Broadening Participation**
   - Recruiting from underrepresented groups
   - Partnerships with MSIs/HBCUs
   - Accessibility and inclusion
   - Support and retention

3. **Educational Integration**
   - Course development
   - Curriculum materials
   - K-12 outreach
   - Public engagement

4. **Dissemination**
   - Open-source software
   - Open data
   - Publications and preprints
   - Conferences and workshops

5. **Societal Impact**
   - Technology transfer
   - Policy implications
   - Economic development
   - National priorities

### Writing Strong Impacts

**Be specific:**
- "We will train 2 PhD students and 4 REU undergraduates" (not "students will be trained")
- "We will develop a 4-week course module released on MIT OCW" (not "educational materials will be created")

**Be connected:**
- Link impacts to your research (not generic outreach)
- Show how research expertise enables impact

**Show evidence:**
- Track record (what have you done before?)
- Resources (what support exists?)
- Commitments (letters of collaboration)

### Example

> **Training and Workforce Development:** This project directly supports two PhD students who will receive training in quantum algorithms, machine learning, and experimental quantum computing. Both students will complete summer internships at partner national laboratories (confirmed letters attached). The project also supports four undergraduate researchers: two through NSF REU supplements and two through academic year research credit. All students will present at national conferences and co-author publications.
>
> **Broadening Participation:** We actively recruit from underrepresented groups through established partnerships. Our REU students will be recruited primarily from minority-serving institutions through the NSF INCLUDES network. The PI's research group currently includes 45% women and 30% underrepresented minorities. We will host an annual quantum computing workshop for students from regional HBCUs.
