## Part 2: The Two Merit Review Criteria

### Criterion 1: Intellectual Merit

The Intellectual Merit criterion encompasses the potential to advance knowledge. Reviewers consider:

1. **What is the potential for the proposed activity to advance knowledge and understanding within its own field or across different fields?**

2. **To what extent do the proposed activities suggest and explore creative, original, or potentially transformative concepts?**

3. **Is the plan for carrying out the proposed activities well-reasoned, well-organized, and based on a sound rationale?**

4. **How well qualified is the individual, team, or organization to conduct the proposed activities?**

5. **Are there adequate resources available to the PI to carry out the proposed activities?**

### Criterion 2: Broader Impacts

The Broader Impacts criterion encompasses the potential to benefit society and contribute to specific, desired societal outcomes:

1. **What is the potential for the proposed activity to benefit society or advance desired societal outcomes?**

2. **To what extent do the proposed activities suggest and explore creative, original, or potentially transformative concepts?**

3. **Is the plan for carrying out the proposed activities well-reasoned, well-organized, and based on a sound rationale?**

4. **How well qualified is the individual, team, or organization to conduct the proposed activities?**

5. **Are there adequate resources available to the PI to carry out the proposed activities?**

### Equal Weight

**Critical:** NSF weights Intellectual Merit and Broader Impacts equally. Proposals weak in either criterion will not be funded, regardless of strength in the other.

---

## Part 4: Project Summary

### The One-Page Synopsis

The Project Summary is often the first (and sometimes only) thing reviewers read carefully. It must contain exactly three components:

**Overview (approximately 200 words):**
- State the research objectives and methods
- Describe the novelty of the approach
- Explain expected outcomes

**Intellectual Merit (approximately 150 words):**
- Explain how the project will advance knowledge
- Highlight innovative aspects
- Connect to broader scientific goals

**Broader Impacts (approximately 150 words):**
- Describe societal benefits
- Include educational and outreach activities
- Address diversity and inclusion

### Writing Tips

**Do:**
- Write in third person
- Be specific and quantitative
- Include key hypotheses
- Stand alone (no jargon requiring explanation)

**Don't:**
- Use first person
- Exceed one page
- Include citations
- Be vague about outcomes

### Example for Quantum Research

> **Overview:** This project develops novel quantum error correction codes optimized for realistic noise in superconducting quantum processors. The research combines theoretical code design with experimental validation on cloud-accessible hardware, targeting a 5x reduction in the physical qubit overhead required for fault-tolerant computation. The approach exploits noise asymmetries inherent to superconducting systems through tailored stabilizer measurements and machine learning-based decoder optimization.
>
> **Intellectual Merit:** The proposed research advances quantum error correction theory by incorporating hardware-specific noise structures into code design, moving beyond the assumption of symmetric error models. This work will establish fundamental limits on overhead reduction for biased-noise systems and provide practical code implementations. The combination of theoretical analysis, numerical simulation, and experimental validation creates a comprehensive framework for near-term fault-tolerant quantum computing.
>
> **Broader Impacts:** This project trains two PhD students and two undergraduate researchers in quantum computing, with active recruitment from underrepresented groups through established REU partnerships. Developed codes and decoders will be released as open-source software. The PI will develop new graduate course materials on practical quantum error correction and deliver public lectures on quantum computing at local science museums.

## Part 5: Project Description

### The 15-Page Core

The Project Description is where you make your scientific case. It must be compelling, complete, and compliant.

### Introduction and Objectives

The opening must accomplish three things in 1-2 paragraphs:

1. **Establish importance** - Why does this research matter?
2. **Identify the gap** - What problem remains unsolved?
3. **State your objective** - What will you accomplish?

Follow with a clear list of 3-4 specific aims:

```
The specific objectives of this proposal are to:

1. Develop [specific methodology] to address [specific problem]
2. Characterize [specific phenomenon] using [specific approach]
3. Demonstrate [specific application] achieving [specific metric]
```

**Paragraph 3:** Specific gap or limitation
**Paragraph 4:** How your approach addresses the gap
**Paragraph 5:** Significance of solving this problem

### Research Plan

Organize by aim, with each aim containing:

1. **Rationale** - Why is this aim necessary?

   - What training will they receive?
   - How does this prepare the workforce?

2. **Broadening Participation**
   - Specific plans for involving underrepresented groups

## Part 8: Review Process

### Panel Review

Most NSF proposals are reviewed by panels:

1. **Assignment:** Program Officer assigns to appropriate panel
2. **Primary/Secondary:** 2-3 reviewers assigned to each proposal
3. **Written Reviews:** Submitted before panel meeting
4. **Panel Discussion:** 15-30 minutes per proposal
5. **Ranking:** Proposals ranked by panel consensus
6. **Recommendation:** Panel recommends fund/decline

### Review Criteria Application

Reviewers explicitly address both merit criteria:

**Intellectual Merit Rating:** Excellent / Very Good / Good / Fair / Poor
**Broader Impacts Rating:** Excellent / Very Good / Good / Fair / Poor
**Overall Rating:** Excellent / Very Good / Good / Fair / Poor

### Success Rates

Current funding rates vary by program:

| Program | Typical Success Rate |
|---------|---------------------|
| Core Physics | 20-25% |
| CAREER | 15-20% |
| Quantum Programs | 15-25% |
| Large Centers | 5-10% |

### After Review

**If funded:**
- Negotiate budget with Program Officer
- Submit revised budget if needed
- Award typically within 3-6 months

**If declined:**
- Request detailed reviews
- Can revise and resubmit
- Consider different program or agency

## Part 9: Common Mistakes

### Formatting Errors (Automatic Rejection)

- Exceeding page limits
- Wrong font size or margins
- Missing required sections
- Incorrect file formats

### Content Weaknesses

1. **Vague methodology**
   - Bad: "We will develop new quantum algorithms"
   - Good: "We will implement a variational quantum eigensolver using COBYLA optimization, targeting H2O molecular simulations with 10-qubit circuits"

2. **Overclaiming**
   - Bad: "This will revolutionize quantum computing"
   - Good: "This will reduce error correction overhead by an estimated 3-5x for biased-noise systems"

3. **Weak broader impacts**
   - Bad: "We will train students"
   - Good: "We will train 2 PhD students and 4 REU undergraduates, including active recruitment from our partner HBCU through the established APS Bridge Program"

4. **Ignoring preliminary data**
   - Include if you have it (even negative results)
   - Shows feasibility and reduces risk

5. **Poor prior support section**
   - Must show publications from previous NSF support
   - Demonstrate productivity and impact

## Part 10: Tips for Success

### Before Writing

1. **Read the solicitation carefully** - 5+ times
2. **Contact Program Officers** - They want to help
3. **Study funded abstracts** - NSF Award Search
4. **Get proposal templates** - From successful colleagues
5. **Plan timeline** - Start 3+ months before deadline

### During Writing

1. **Write Specific Aims first** - Everything flows from there
2. **Get early feedback** - From non-specialists too
3. **Use figures strategically** - Worth 1000 words
4. **Be specific** - Quantify wherever possible
5. **Address weaknesses** - Show you've thought it through

### Before Submission

1. **Have others proofread** - Fresh eyes catch errors
2. **Check compliance** - Every formatting rule
3. **Submit early** - System crashes near deadlines
4. **Verify uploads** - Preview your submission

### Key Mindset

Write for reviewers who are:
- Experts in your broad area (not your exact specialty)
- Reading 10-15 proposals in a short time
- Looking for reasons to rank you highly
- Also looking for weaknesses to justify ranking

Make their job easy. Make your proposal impossible to ignore.
