---

## Week Deliverables

### Required Submissions

1. **Annotated Proposal Outline** (500-800 words)
   - Complete section-by-section structure
   - Key points for each section
   - Placeholder for references

2. **Specific Aims Page** (Draft 1)
   - Overall objective
   - 3-4 specific aims with hypotheses
   - Expected outcomes/significance

3. **Funding Agency Comparison Notes**
   - NSF vs. DOE: Which fits your research?
   - Justification for agency choice

---

## Key Concepts

### The Proposal Hierarchy
```
Title (10 words)
    ↓
Abstract (250 words)
    ↓
Specific Aims (1 page)
    ↓
Full Proposal (15 pages)
    ↓
Supporting Documents (CVs, budgets, etc.)
```

### Reviewer Psychology
Reviewers are:
- **Busy** - Make key points immediately clear
- **Expert but not specialist** - Explain jargon
- **Looking for reasons to say yes AND no** - Address weaknesses
- **Human** - Tell a compelling story

### The "So What?" Test
Every section must answer:
- Why does this matter?
- Why now?
- Why you?
- Why this approach?

---

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Structural Errors
- Exceeding page limits
- Missing required sections
- Incorrect margins/fonts
- Poor section organization

### Content Errors
- Vague aims ("We will study...")
- Overly ambitious scope
- Ignoring broader impacts
- Weak preliminary data presentation

### Strategic Errors
- Wrong agency choice
- Misunderstanding review criteria
- Ignoring RFP-specific requirements
- Submitting to wrong program

## Self-Check Questions

After this week, you should be able to answer:

1. What are the two primary NSF review criteria?
2. How does DOE's Technical Volume differ from NSF's Project Description?
3. What are the components of a strong Specific Aims page?
4. How do page limits differ between NSF and DOE?
5. What makes your research a good fit for your chosen agency?

## Looking Ahead

Next week (Week 206) focuses on **Methodology Development**:
- Experimental design
- Computational approaches
- Theoretical frameworks
- Risk assessment

Your outline from this week will be the skeleton that methodology fills in.

*"The best proposals are written from the Specific Aims outward. Get that page right, and the rest follows."*
