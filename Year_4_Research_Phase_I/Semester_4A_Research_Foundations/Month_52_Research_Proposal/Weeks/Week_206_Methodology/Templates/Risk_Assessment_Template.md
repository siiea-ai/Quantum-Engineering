## Part 1: Risk Identification

### Brainstorming Checklist

For each aim, consider:

**Technical Risks**
- [ ] What if primary method doesn't work?
- [ ] What if measurements aren't precise enough?
- [ ] What if model assumptions are violated?
- [ ] What if computational resources are insufficient?
- [ ] What if preliminary data doesn't generalize?
- [ ] What if algorithm doesn't converge?
- [ ] What if hardware noise is too high?

**Resource Risks**
- [ ] What equipment might fail or be unavailable?
- [ ] What materials might be delayed or unavailable?
- [ ] What computing resources might run out?
- [ ] What if funding is delayed or reduced?

**Personnel Risks**
- [ ] What if key team members leave?
- [ ] What expertise gaps exist?
- [ ] What if collaborators don't deliver?
- [ ] What if student progress is slow?

**External Risks**
- [ ] What facility access might be limited?
- [ ] What could competitors do?
- [ ] What policy/regulatory changes could affect us?
- [ ] What if hardware access is disrupted?

**Timeline Risks**
- [ ] Which tasks might take longer than expected?
- [ ] What dependencies could cause delays?
- [ ] What external reviews might slow progress?
- [ ] What publication delays might occur?
