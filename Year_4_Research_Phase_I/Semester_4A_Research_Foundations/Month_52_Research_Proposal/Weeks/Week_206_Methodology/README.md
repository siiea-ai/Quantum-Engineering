## Key Concepts

### The Methodology Hierarchy

```
RESEARCH QUESTION
    ↓
SPECIFIC AIMS
    ↓
METHODS (for each aim)
    ├── Experimental protocols
    ├── Computational approaches
    └── Theoretical analysis
    ↓
EXPECTED OUTCOMES
    ↓
VALIDATION CRITERIA
```

### Characteristics of Strong Methodology

1. **Specific:** Exact protocols, parameters, tools
2. **Justified:** Why this method over alternatives
3. **Feasible:** Achievable with available resources
4. **Rigorous:** Proper controls, statistics, validation
5. **Connected:** Methods support each other

### Common Methodology Weaknesses

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Too vague | Add specific parameters, tools, protocols |
| Not justified | Explain why this approach over alternatives |
| Overly ambitious | Reduce scope or extend timeline |
| No validation | Add controls, benchmarks, known results |
| Missing pitfalls | Conduct systematic risk assessment |

## Self-Check Questions

After this week, you should be able to answer:

1. What are the specific methods for each aim?
2. Why did you choose these methods over alternatives?
3. What are the key parameters and success criteria?
4. What could go wrong, and what's your backup plan?
5. How will you validate that methods are working?

---

## Looking Ahead

Next week (Week 207) focuses on **Proposal Writing**:
- Drafting the complete proposal
- Creating Gantt charts and timelines
- Writing compelling narratives
- Balancing technical depth and accessibility

Your methodology section will be the technical core that the narrative wraps around.

*"Methods are promises about how you'll do the work. Make them specific enough that you could actually follow them."*
