# Guide: Proposal Review and Revision

## Introduction

Writing is rewriting. The difference between a good proposal and a great proposal often comes down to revision. This guide provides systematic approaches for evaluating, revising, and polishing your research proposal to submission quality.

## Part 1: The Revision Mindset

### Distance Creates Clarity

After intense writing, you're too close to see your proposal clearly. Create distance:
- Wait 24+ hours before major revisions
- Read in a different format (print vs. screen)
- Read in a different location
- Have others read and respond

### Be Your Own Skeptic

When revising, adopt the mindset of a skeptical reviewer:
- "Why should I believe this?"
- "Is this really feasible?"
- "What could go wrong?"
- "Why is this better than alternatives?"

If you can't answer these questions, neither can reviewers.

### The Goal of Revision

Revision is not about:
- Making it longer
- Adding more fancy words
- Defending your current text

Revision is about:
- Making ideas clearer
- Strengthening arguments
- Removing obstacles to understanding
- Making the proposal impossible to ignore

## Part 2: Structured Self-Review

### The Three-Pass Method

**Pass 1: Big Picture (30 minutes)**
- Read the entire proposal in one sitting
- Note overall impressions
- Identify major gaps or problems
- Assess logical flow

**Pass 2: Section-by-Section (2 hours)**
- Evaluate each section against rubric
- Rate sections on 1-5 scale
- Write notes on strengths and weaknesses
- Identify specific fixes needed

**Pass 3: Line-by-Line (3+ hours)**
- Read every sentence critically
- Check for clarity and precision
- Verify claims are supported
- Polish language

### Section-Specific Review

## Part 4: Common Weaknesses and Fixes

### Weakness: Vague Methodology

**Symptom:** Reviewers ask "How exactly will they do this?"

**Diagnosis:**
- Methods not specific enough
- Parameters not stated
- Success criteria unclear

**Fix:**
- Add specific protocols
- State numerical parameters
- Define measurable outcomes

**Before:**
> We will develop new codes using optimization methods.

**After:**
> We will optimize codes using a genetic algorithm with population size 500, mutation rate 0.02, and fitness function weighted for bias ratio η, running for 2000 generations or until fitness plateaus for 100 generations.

---

### Weakness: Unsupported Claims

**Symptom:** Reviewers ask "Why should I believe this?"

**Diagnosis:**
- Claims without evidence
- Missing citations
- Overconfident assertions

**Fix:**
- Add citations
- Include preliminary data
- Soften claims or provide support

**Before:**
> Our approach will solve the decoherence problem.

**After:**
> Preliminary simulations suggest our approach reduces logical error rates by 3x for bias ratios of 10:1 (Figure 1), consistent with theoretical predictions [ref]. We will validate this advantage on hardware in Aim 3.

---

### Weakness: Weak Broader Impacts

**Symptom:** Low broader impacts score

**Diagnosis:**
- Generic or vague statements
- Not connected to research
- No evidence of commitment

**Fix:**
- Add specific activities
- Connect to research expertise
- Provide evidence (track record, letters)

**Before:**
> We will train students and do outreach.

**After:**
> We will train 2 PhD students and 4 REU undergraduates, with REU recruitment focused on partner HBCUs (Howard University, letter attached). The PI's group includes 40% women and 30% URM, exceeding field averages. All students will present at national conferences and co-author publications.

---

### Weakness: Overly Ambitious Scope

**Symptom:** Reviewers question feasibility

**Diagnosis:**
- Too many aims
- Timeline too compressed
- Resources don't match scope

**Fix:**
- Reduce scope
- Add time or resources
- Reframe as focused contribution

**Before:**
> We will develop complete error correction for all quantum computing platforms.

**After:**
> We will develop optimized error correction codes for superconducting qubits with biased noise. While our methods are general, we focus on this platform to enable thorough validation on available hardware.

---

### Weakness: Missing Connections

**Symptom:** Proposal reads as disconnected pieces

**Diagnosis:**
- Aims don't build on each other
- Background doesn't motivate methods
- Impact doesn't follow from aims

**Fix:**
- Add explicit connections
- Strengthen transitions
- Show logical progression

**Before:**
> Aim 1... Aim 2... Aim 3... (independent descriptions)

**After:**
> Aim 1 establishes the theoretical framework for biased-noise codes. Building on these optimized code designs, Aim 2 develops decoders that leverage the same noise structure. Aim 3 validates both contributions on hardware, using codes from Aim 1 and decoders from Aim 2.

---

### Weakness: Passive Voice Overuse

**Symptom:** Writing feels weak and bureaucratic

**Diagnosis:**
- Too much "will be done"
- Actor unclear
- Responsibility diffused

**Fix:**
- Convert to active voice
- Identify who does what
- Make claims confidently

**Before:**
> The codes will be optimized and the results will be analyzed.

**After:**
> We will optimize codes using genetic algorithms and analyze results using statistical comparison to standard approaches.

## Part 5: The Revision Process

### Stage 1: Triage (Day 1)

**Goal:** Identify what needs fixing

1. Read entire proposal without editing
2. Note impressions and problems
3. Complete self-review rubric
4. Compile issue list

**Categorize issues:**
- **Critical:** Must fix or proposal fails
- **Important:** Significantly improves proposal
- **Nice-to-have:** Would be better but not essential

### Stage 2: Major Revisions (Days 2-3)

**Goal:** Fix critical and important issues

1. Address critical issues first
2. Work on one issue at a time
3. Check that fixes don't create new problems
4. Verify all critical issues resolved

**Common major revisions:**
- Strengthening methodology
- Adding missing sections
- Clarifying aims
- Improving significance

### Stage 3: Incorporate Feedback (Day 3)

**Goal:** Learn from others' perspectives

1. Review all feedback received
2. Categorize: essential vs. optional
3. Address essential items
4. Note items not addressed (and why)

**Handling conflicting feedback:**
- Trust consistent feedback from multiple readers
- Consider expertise of each reviewer
- Make your own judgment on disputed points

### Stage 4: Polish (Day 4)

**Goal:** Make every sentence count

1. Read for flow and rhythm
2. Cut unnecessary words
3. Strengthen weak verbs
4. Check transitions

**Word-level polish:**
- Replace weak verbs (is, has, does)
- Cut filler words (very, really, basically)
- Use parallel structure in lists
- Vary sentence length

### Stage 5: Technical Check (Day 5)

**Goal:** Ensure compliance and consistency

1. Verify formatting requirements
2. Check page limits
3. Complete references
4. Finalize figures

**Formatting checklist:**
- [ ] Correct font and size
- [ ] Correct margins
- [ ] Page numbers present
- [ ] Section headings consistent
- [ ] Figure/table numbering correct
- [ ] Citations formatted correctly

### Stage 6: Final Review (Day 6-7)

**Goal:** Last chance for improvements

1. Print and read on paper
2. Read aloud
3. Have someone else proofread
4. Verify all issues addressed

---

## Part 6: Editing Techniques

### The "So What?" Test

After every major statement, ask "So what?" If you can't answer, the statement needs work.

**Weak:**
> Quantum computers can solve certain problems efficiently.

*So what?*

**Strong:**
> Quantum computers can solve optimization problems in hours that would take classical computers millions of years, enabling breakthroughs in drug discovery and materials design that are currently impossible.

### The Zoom Test

Can a reviewer understand your key points by reading only:
- Title and abstract
- First sentences of each paragraph
- Figures and captions

If not, restructure to frontload key information.

### The Substitution Test

Replace your abstract with a competitor's. Does the proposal still make sense? If so, your abstract is too generic.

### The Red Pen Pass

Print your proposal and mark in red:
- Every vague word
- Every passive voice sentence
- Every unsupported claim
- Every undefined term

Then address each red mark.
