## Key Concepts

### The Revision Hierarchy

Address issues in this order:

```
1. CONTENT (Most Important)
   ├── Missing sections or information
   ├── Logical gaps or errors
   ├── Weak arguments or unsupported claims
   └── Scope or feasibility problems

2. ORGANIZATION
   ├── Section order and flow
   ├── Paragraph structure
   ├── Transitions and connections
   └── Balance between sections

3. CLARITY
   ├── Jargon and undefined terms
   ├── Overly complex sentences
   ├── Vague or imprecise language
   └── Passive voice overuse

4. STYLE
   ├── Word choice
   ├── Sentence variety
   ├── Tone and voice
   └── Readability

5. MECHANICS (Least Important)
   ├── Grammar and punctuation
   ├── Spelling
   ├── Formatting
   └── Citations
```

### The Reviewer's Perspective

When self-reviewing, think like a reviewer who:
- Has 10 other proposals to read today
- Is expert in your general area, not your specific topic
- Is looking for reasons to rank you highly
- Is also looking for weaknesses to justify concerns

### Common Revision Mistakes

| Mistake | Better Approach |
|---------|-----------------|
| Only fixing grammar | Address content first |
| Adding more detail everywhere | Cut unnecessary content |
| Ignoring negative feedback | Address or explain why not |
| Last-minute major changes | Make big changes early |
| Not reading aloud | Read aloud for flow |
