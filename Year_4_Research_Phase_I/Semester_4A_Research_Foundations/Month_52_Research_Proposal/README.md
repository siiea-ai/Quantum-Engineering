## Why Research Proposal Writing Matters

### Academic Career Foundation
Research proposals are the currency of academic science:
- **Funding acquisition** - NSF, DOE, DARPA, private foundations
- **PhD advancement** - Qualifying exams, thesis committee approval
- **Postdoc applications** - Independent research plans
- **Faculty positions** - Research statements and startup negotiations
