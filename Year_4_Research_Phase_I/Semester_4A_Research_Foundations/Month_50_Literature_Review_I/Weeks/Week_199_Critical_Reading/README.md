## The Three-Pass Reading Method

### First Pass (5-10 minutes per paper)

**Goal:** Get the big picture, decide if worth reading deeply

**Read:**
1. Title, abstract, keywords
2. Introduction (first 2 paragraphs)
3. Section headings only
4. Figures and tables (captions only)
5. Conclusion

**Questions to Answer:**
- What category of paper is this? (empirical, theoretical, review)
- What is the main contribution?
- Is it relevant to my research questions?
- What is the context and assumptions?

**Decision:** Continue to second pass? Yes/No/Maybe

---

### Second Pass (1-2 hours per paper)

**Goal:** Understand the paper's content in depth

**Read:**
1. Full paper, but don't dwell on proofs/details
2. Study figures and tables carefully
3. Note unfamiliar terms to look up later
4. Mark key claims and evidence

**Focus On:**
- Motivation and problem statement
- Key methodology and approach
- Main results and evidence
- How results support conclusions
- Limitations acknowledged

**Annotate:**
- Highlight key findings (yellow)
- Mark methodology (green)
- Note limitations (red)
- Ideas for your work (blue)

**Output:** Summary of contributions, methods, findings, limitations

---

### Third Pass (4-5 hours per paper)

**Goal:** Deep understanding, ability to reconstruct paper

**Reserved For:** Only the most critical papers (top 5-10)

**Activities:**
- Virtually re-implement the work
- Challenge every assumption
- Derive key equations
- Consider alternative approaches
- Identify what's missing

**Questions:**
- Could I present this paper to others?
- What would I do differently?
- What are the hidden assumptions?
- How does this connect to other work?

## Annotation Color Coding System

| Color | Purpose | Examples |
|-------|---------|----------|
| **Yellow** | Key findings, contributions | "We achieve X% improvement" |
| **Green** | Methodology, approach | "We use a CNN architecture with..." |
| **Red** | Limitations, weaknesses | "This assumes noise-free..." |
| **Blue** | Ideas, connections | "This could apply to my project" |
| **Purple** | Definitions, key terms | "Surface code: a topological..." |
| **Orange** | Questions, unclear points | "How does this scale?" |

## Common Reading Pitfalls

### Avoid:
1. **Reading passively:** Always annotate and take notes
2. **Reading linearly:** Use three-pass method strategically
3. **Getting stuck on details:** Note and return later
4. **Not tracking connections:** Maintain cross-paper notes
5. **Skipping figures:** Figures often contain key results
6. **Ignoring limitations:** Critical for gap identification

### Best Practices:
1. **Time-box reading:** Don't exceed allocated time per paper
2. **Regular breaks:** Deep reading is cognitively demanding
3. **Immediate summaries:** Write summary right after reading
4. **Cross-reference:** Note connections as you read
5. **Question everything:** Maintain critical perspective
