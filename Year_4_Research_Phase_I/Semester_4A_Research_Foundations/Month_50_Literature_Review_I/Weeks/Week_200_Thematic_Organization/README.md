## Theme Identification Framework

### What is a Theme?

A theme is a recurring pattern, topic, or idea across multiple papers that helps organize understanding.

**Good themes are:**
- Present across multiple papers
- Meaningful for your research questions
- Distinct but related to other themes
- Actionable for organizing your review

### Theme Types

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Topical** | Subject matter focus | "Surface code decoders" |
| **Methodological** | Approach-based | "Neural network approaches" |
| **Temporal** | Time-based evolution | "Pre-2020 vs. post-2020" |
| **Outcome** | Results-focused | "Threshold improvements" |
| **Application** | Use-case based | "Near-term applications" |

### Theme Identification Process

1. **Bottom-up:** Read through summaries, note recurring topics
2. **Top-down:** Use your RQs to suggest expected themes
3. **Combine:** Merge approaches, refine categories
4. **Validate:** Ensure all papers fit somewhere
5. **Iterate:** Adjust as understanding deepens
