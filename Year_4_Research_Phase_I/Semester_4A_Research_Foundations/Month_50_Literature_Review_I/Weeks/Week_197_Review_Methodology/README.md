# Week 197: Systematic Literature Review Methodology

## Overview

**Week 197** | Days 1373-1379 | Month 50, Week 1

This week establishes the foundation for your systematic literature review. You will learn the principles of evidence-based research synthesis, set up professional reference management tools, and develop a comprehensive review protocol that will guide your literature review process.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of Week 197, you will be able to:

1. Explain the rationale and methodology behind systematic literature reviews
2. Apply the Kitchenham framework to design a review protocol
3. Formulate precise, answerable research questions for your review
4. Set up and configure Zotero or Mendeley for professional reference management
5. Design a comprehensive search strategy with defined inclusion/exclusion criteria
6. Create data extraction and quality assessment forms

## Reflection Questions

1. Why is systematic methodology important for literature reviews?
2. How will your research questions guide paper selection?
3. What challenges do you anticipate in your search strategy?
4. How will you ensure your review is reproducible?
5. What bias might you bring, and how will you mitigate it?

---

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Too broad research questions:** Make them specific and answerable
2. **Inadequate search strategy:** Use multiple databases and synonyms
3. **Vague selection criteria:** Be explicit about what's included/excluded
4. **Skipping protocol:** Don't start searching without a protocol
5. **Poor reference management:** Set up properly from day one
