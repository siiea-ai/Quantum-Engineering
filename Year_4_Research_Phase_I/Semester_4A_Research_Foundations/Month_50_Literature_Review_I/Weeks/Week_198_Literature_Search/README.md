# Week 198: Comprehensive Literature Search

## Overview

**Week 198** | Days 1380-1386 | Month 50, Week 2

This week transforms your search strategy from Week 197 into action. You will execute systematic searches across multiple databases, collect and organize papers, apply your screening criteria, and build a comprehensive paper collection for deep reading in Week 199.

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of Week 198, you will be able to:

1. Execute Boolean search queries across multiple academic databases
2. Navigate arXiv, Google Scholar, IEEE Xplore, and Web of Science effectively
3. Apply forward and backward snowballing techniques
4. Manage and deduplicate large collections of papers
5. Apply screening criteria consistently to paper selection
6. Document your search process for reproducibility

## Reflection Questions

1. Which database provided the most useful results?
2. What search terms were most/least effective?
3. Did you discover papers you didn't expect?
4. What gaps remain in your coverage?
5. How confident are you in completeness?
