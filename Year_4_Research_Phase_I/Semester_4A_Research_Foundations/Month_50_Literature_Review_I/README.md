# Month 50: Deep Literature Review I

## Overview

**Month 50** | Days 1373-1400 | Weeks 197-200 | Systematic Literature Review Methodology

This month marks the beginning of your formal literature review process. Having selected a research direction in Month 49, you now embark on a systematic, rigorous exploration of the existing knowledge in your chosen area. Mastering literature review methodology is not just an academic exercise—it is the foundation upon which all meaningful research is built.

## The Systematic Literature Review Process

### Why Systematic?

Traditional "narrative" literature reviews can be:
- Biased by author preferences
- Incomplete due to ad-hoc searching
- Non-reproducible
- Subject to cherry-picking

**Systematic Literature Reviews (SLRs)** address these issues through:

$$\text{SLR} = \text{Explicit Protocol} + \text{Comprehensive Search} + \text{Systematic Analysis}$$

### The Kitchenham Framework

Barbara Kitchenham's guidelines for SLRs in software engineering have become the gold standard for evidence-based reviews:

1. **Planning the Review**
   - Identify the need for a review
   - Define research questions
   - Develop review protocol

2. **Conducting the Review**
   - Identify research (search strategy)
   - Select primary studies (inclusion/exclusion)
   - Assess study quality
   - Extract data
   - Synthesize data

3. **Reporting the Review**
   - Write up findings
   - Validate conclusions
   - Disseminate results

## Key Concepts

### Research Questions for Literature Review

Your SLR should address specific questions. Common types:

| Question Type | Example |
|--------------|---------|
| **Prevalence** | What approaches exist for surface code decoding? |
| **Comparison** | How do neural network decoders compare to MWPM? |
| **Evolution** | How has the field of variational algorithms developed? |
| **Application** | What problems have been solved using QML? |
| **Gap** | What remains unknown about noise-aware VQE? |

### Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria

Define clear criteria before searching:

**Include:**
- Peer-reviewed articles, conference papers, preprints
- Published within relevant timeframe (e.g., 2015-present)
- Written in English
- Directly related to your research questions
- Sufficient methodological detail

**Exclude:**
- Duplicate reports of same study
- Opinion pieces without empirical content
- Papers in languages you cannot read
- Work too tangential to your focus

### Quality Assessment

Rate papers on dimensions like:
- **Rigor:** Sound methodology, clear assumptions
- **Credibility:** Author expertise, venue quality
- **Relevance:** Direct applicability to your research
- **Impact:** Citations, influence on field

("quantum error correction" OR QEC OR "surface code")
AND
(decoder OR decoding OR "neural network" OR "machine learning")
AND
(threshold OR performance OR fidelity)
```

### Database-Specific Strategies

| Database | Strengths | Strategy |
|----------|-----------|----------|
| **arXiv** | Preprints, current | quant-ph category, keyword search |
| **Google Scholar** | Broad coverage | Cited by tracking |
| **WoS** | Citation metrics | JCR journals focus |
