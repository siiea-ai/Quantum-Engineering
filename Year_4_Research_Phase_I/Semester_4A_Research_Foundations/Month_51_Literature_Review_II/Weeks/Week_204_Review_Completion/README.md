**Theoretical:** Organize by theoretical frameworks
**Debate-Focused:** Structure around key controversies

## Writing Principles

### Voice and Tone

- **Authoritative**: You are the expert synthesizing the literature
- **Objective**: Present evidence fairly
- **Critical**: Evaluate, don't just describe
- **Clear**: Accessible to educated non-specialists

### Synthesis Writing Tips

**Instead of:**
> "Smith (2020) found X. Jones (2021) found Y. Brown (2022) found Z."

**Write:**
> "Recent advances have established X (Smith, 2020), with subsequent work extending these findings to Y (Jones, 2021) and Z (Brown, 2022). Collectively, this body of work suggests..."

### Citation Practices

- Cite original sources, not secondary citations
- Use recent citations where possible
- Balance citations across research groups
- Include seminal works even if older
- Cite reviews for broad claims, primaries for specifics

## Common Writing Issues

### Issue 1: Description Without Synthesis
**Problem:** Summarizing papers one-by-one
**Solution:** Write about themes, not papers

### Issue 2: Missing Your Voice
**Problem:** Pure reporting without analysis
**Solution:** State your interpretations and evaluations

### Issue 3: Citation Overload
**Problem:** Too many citations per sentence
**Solution:** Group citations, cite reviews for broad claims

### Issue 4: Scope Creep
**Problem:** Review becomes unfocused
**Solution:** Return to research questions; cut tangents

### Issue 5: Weak Transitions
**Problem:** Sections feel disconnected
**Solution:** Explicit transition sentences between sections
