## Reading Strategy for Unfamiliar Fields

### The PIVOT Method

1. **P**rimer: Start with review articles in the new field
2. **I**dentify: Find key terminology and concepts
3. **V**alidate: Cross-reference with your core knowledge
4. **O**rganize: Map new concepts to familiar frameworks
5. **T**ransfer: Extract applicable methods and insights

### Efficiency Techniques

- Focus on abstracts, conclusions, and figures first
- Use glossaries and Wikipedia for unfamiliar terms
- Read review articles before primary literature
- Take notes in your own words to ensure understanding
- Ask: "How does this relate to my research question?"
