## Tips for Success

### Literature Management
1. **Don't try to read everything** - Learn to skim effectively
2. **Use the abstract-conclusion method** - Read abstract, then conclusion, then decide if full read is warranted
3. **Build a paper processing pipeline** - Capture, triage, process, cite
4. **Take structured notes** - Use the annotation template consistently

### Identifying Good Problems
1. **Look for contradictions** - Where do papers disagree?
2. **Follow the "future work"** - Authors often identify next steps
3. **Attend to what's missing** - What should exist but doesn't?
4. **Talk to people** - Conversations reveal problems

### Choosing Your Direction
1. **Match interests to opportunities** - Passion sustains effort
2. **Consider tractability** - Can you make progress in your PhD timeline?
3. **Assess resources** - What equipment, expertise, collaborations are available?
4. **Think about career paths** - Where does this lead?
