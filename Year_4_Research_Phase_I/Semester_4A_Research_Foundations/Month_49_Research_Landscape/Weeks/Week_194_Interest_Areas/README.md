# Week 194: Interest Areas Deep Dive

## Overview

**Days:** 1352-1358
**Theme:** Comprehensive Investigation of Selected Research Areas
**Goal:** Develop deep understanding of 3 potential research areas

---

## Introduction

Having surveyed the broad quantum computing landscape in Week 193, you now focus your attention on three areas that emerged as most interesting. This week is about depth rather than breadth—understanding the state of the art, key players, seminal contributions, and open problems in each area.

The three-area approach serves multiple purposes:
1. **Comparison** - Seeing multiple areas in depth enables informed decision-making
2. **Backup Plans** - Research directions sometimes don't work out; having alternatives is wise
3. **Intersection Discovery** - Deep knowledge of multiple areas reveals unique intersection opportunities
4. **Informed Rejection** - Even areas you don't choose inform your research perspective

By week's end, you will have produced detailed evaluation reports for three areas and preliminary rankings for your research direction.

## Tips for Effective Deep Dives

### Reading Strategy

**Seminal Papers:** Read carefully, understand deeply
- These define the vocabulary and concepts
- Take detailed notes
- Follow key derivations

**Review Papers:** Read strategically
- Use for broad coverage
- Focus on open problems sections
- Extract key references

**Recent Papers:** Read efficiently
- Focus on what's new/different
- Note incremental vs. substantial advances
- Track who is publishing what

### Note-Taking

**For Each Area, Maintain:**
- Concept glossary (definitions and relationships)
- Key results table (who, what, when)
- Open problems list (with sources)
- Research group profiles
- Connection map (how ideas relate)

### Avoiding Pitfalls

1. **Confirmation Bias:** Don't just look for evidence supporting your initial preference
2. **Novelty Bias:** Don't be swayed by the most recent/flashy work
3. **Depth Trap:** Don't go so deep you can't compare fairly
4. **Breadth Trap:** Don't stay too shallow to make informed judgments
