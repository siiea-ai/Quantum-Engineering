# Week 193: Research Frontiers Survey

## Overview

**Days:** 1345-1351
**Theme:** Surveying the Quantum Computing Research Landscape
**Goal:** Develop a comprehensive map of current research frontiers

---

## Introduction

This week marks the beginning of your transition from student to researcher. Before you can identify where to contribute, you must understand the landscape—what questions drive the field, who is working on them, and where the frontier currently lies.

A systematic survey serves multiple purposes:
1. **Orientation** - Understanding where your prior knowledge fits in the research context
2. **Opportunity Identification** - Spotting areas ripe for contribution
3. **Network Mapping** - Identifying key researchers and groups
4. **Trend Analysis** - Understanding where the field is heading

By the end of this week, you will have created a comprehensive research landscape map that will guide your deeper investigations in subsequent weeks.

## Tips for Efficient Literature Survey

### The Abstract-Conclusion Method
1. Read abstract carefully
2. Skip to conclusions
3. If interesting, read introduction
4. If still relevant, read full paper
5. Most papers: 10 minutes, not 2 hours

### Building Mental Models
- Don't memorize details; understand structures
- Ask: What problem? What approach? What result? What remains?
- Connect new papers to existing knowledge

### Managing Information Overload
- Accept you cannot read everything
- Focus on reviews and highly-cited recent papers
- Trust your filtering instincts
- Take structured notes to offload memory
