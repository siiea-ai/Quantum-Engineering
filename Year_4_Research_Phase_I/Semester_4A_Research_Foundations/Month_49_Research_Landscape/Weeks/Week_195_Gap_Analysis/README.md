# Week 195: Gap Analysis and Problem Identification

## Overview

**Days:** 1359-1365
**Theme:** Identifying Research Gaps and Evaluating Open Problems
**Goal:** Systematically identify specific research opportunities and assess their feasibility

---

## Introduction

Having deeply explored three research areas in Week 194, you now turn to the critical task of identifying specific research gaps—the spaces between what is known and what needs to be known. Gap analysis is the bridge between understanding a field and contributing to it.

This week focuses on three interconnected activities:
1. **Gap Mapping** - Systematically identifying what's missing in each area
2. **Problem Characterization** - Assessing tractability, impact, and feasibility of identified gaps
3. **Opportunity Ranking** - Creating a prioritized list of potential research problems

The output of this week directly feeds into your research direction selection in Week 196.

## What is a Research Gap?

A research gap is a space where:
- Knowledge is incomplete or missing
- Methods don't exist or are inadequate
- Theory and practice diverge
- Different results conflict
- Natural next steps haven't been taken

**Not all gaps are good research opportunities.** A good research problem is a gap that is:
- **Important** - Solving it matters to the community
- **Tractable** - Progress is achievable with available resources
- **Timely** - The field is ready for this problem to be solved
- **Appropriate** - Matches your skills, interests, and timeline

## Tips for Effective Gap Analysis

### Common Patterns

**Where Gaps Hide:**
1. At boundaries between subareas
2. In "obvious" next steps nobody has taken
3. In applications of methods to new domains
4. In scaling small results to larger systems
5. In connecting theory to experiment

**Warning Signs of Pseudo-Gaps:**
1. Solved in literature you haven't found
2. Too hard (everyone has tried and failed)
3. Not actually interesting to the community
4. Requires resources nobody has
5. Solves itself with normal field progress

### Validation Strategies

**Before committing to a gap:**
1. Search extensively (Google Scholar, arXiv) to confirm it's open
2. Check if leading groups are working on it
3. Ask experienced researchers if it's real
4. Consider why it hasn't been solved
5. Estimate what solving it would require
