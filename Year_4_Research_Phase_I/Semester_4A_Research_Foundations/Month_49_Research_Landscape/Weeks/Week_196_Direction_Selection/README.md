# Week 196: Research Direction Selection

## Overview

**Days:** 1366-1372
**Theme:** Choosing and Articulating Your Research Direction
**Goal:** Select your research direction and write a compelling research interest statement

---

## Introduction

This is the culmination of Month 49. You have:
- Surveyed the research landscape (Week 193)
- Deeply investigated three potential areas (Week 194)
- Identified and characterized research gaps and problems (Week 195)

Now you must make a decision and articulate it clearly. This week is about synthesis, decision-making, and communication.

The primary deliverable is your **Research Interest Statement**—a 2-3 page document that articulates your research direction, why it matters, and how you plan to approach it. This statement serves multiple purposes:
- Clarifies your own thinking
- Communicates your direction to advisors
- Forms the foundation for your research proposal (Month 52)
- Demonstrates your readiness for independent research

## Tips for Writing Your Statement

### What Makes a Good Statement

**Clarity:** The reader should understand exactly what you want to work on

**Motivation:** The reader should understand why this matters

**Credibility:** The reader should believe you can do this

**Engagement:** The reader should want to keep reading

**Specificity:** Avoid vague generalities; be concrete

### Common Mistakes

1. **Too broad:** "I want to study quantum computing"
2. **Too narrow:** Technical details without context
3. **No motivation:** What problem are you solving?
4. **No personal connection:** Why you?
5. **Overselling:** Unrealistic claims about impact
6. **Underselling:** Not conveying why this is interesting
7. **Poor writing:** Unclear sentences, typos, jargon

### Writing Process Tips

1. **Start with your problem statement** - Get this crystal clear first
2. **Build context around it** - What does the reader need to know?
3. **Connect to impact** - So what?
4. **Add personal elements** - Why you?
5. **Revise, revise, revise** - First drafts are always rough
