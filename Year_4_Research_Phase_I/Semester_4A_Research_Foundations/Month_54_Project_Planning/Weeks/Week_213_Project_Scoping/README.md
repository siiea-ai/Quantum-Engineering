# Week 213: Project Scoping

## Overview

**Days:** 1485-1491
**Theme:** Defining Research Boundaries and Success Criteria
**Focus:** Establishing clear, achievable project scope with measurable outcomes

Week 213 marks the beginning of Month 54's intensive planning phase. This week focuses on the critical task of defining exactly what your research project will—and won't—accomplish. Effective scoping prevents the two most common research pitfalls: scope creep and overambitious timelines.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of Week 213, you will be able to:

1. Articulate your research project's core contribution in one clear sentence
2. Define MVP (Minimum Viable Project) deliverables versus stretch goals
3. Establish measurable success criteria aligned with PhD requirements
4. Map resource requirements and dependencies
5. Communicate project scope effectively to advisors and collaborators

## Daily Schedule

### Day 1485 (Monday): Scope Fundamentals
- **Morning:** Review project scoping frameworks (SMART, PICO, 5W1H)
- **Afternoon:** Draft initial scope statement using Guide.md methodology
- **Evening:** Self-assessment of scope clarity

### Day 1486 (Tuesday): Core Contribution Definition
- **Morning:** Identify the single most important research contribution
- **Afternoon:** Distinguish between necessary and sufficient conditions for success
- **Evening:** Peer feedback session on contribution statement

### Day 1487 (Wednesday): MVP Identification
- **Morning:** Apply MVP thinking to research deliverables
- **Afternoon:** Categorize all potential outputs (must-have/should-have/nice-to-have)
- **Evening:** Resource mapping for MVP deliverables

### Day 1488 (Thursday): Stretch Goals and Extensions
- **Morning:** Identify stretch goals that enhance but don't define success
- **Afternoon:** Create dependency map between MVP and extensions
- **Evening:** Prioritization exercise for stretch goals

### Day 1489 (Friday): Success Criteria Development
- **Morning:** Define quantitative success metrics
- **Afternoon:** Develop qualitative success indicators
- **Evening:** Align criteria with PhD committee expectations

### Day 1490 (Saturday): Boundary Setting
- **Morning:** Explicit statement of what is OUT of scope
- **Afternoon:** Identify adjacent problems to defer to future work
- **Evening:** Documentation of scope decisions and rationale

### Day 1491 (Sunday): Integration and Review
- **Morning:** Complete Project_Scope.md template
- **Afternoon:** Complete Success_Criteria.md template
- **Evening:** Advisor discussion preparation

## Key Concepts

### The Scoping Paradox
Research requires both ambition and constraint. Too narrow a scope limits impact; too broad risks completion. The goal is to find the "Goldilocks zone" where:
- The project makes a meaningful contribution
- The timeline is realistic given resources
- There's room for productive failure and iteration

### MVP for Research
Minimum Viable Project (MVP) in research means:
- **Minimum:** The smallest scope that still answers your research question
- **Viable:** Results that are publishable and contribute to the field
- **Project:** A coherent, bounded piece of work with clear deliverables

### SMART Criteria for Research Scope
- **Specific:** Clearly defined research questions and methods
- **Measurable:** Quantifiable outcomes and milestones
- **Achievable:** Realistic given time, resources, and expertise
- **Relevant:** Aligned with PhD requirements and field needs
- **Time-bound:** Specific deadlines for each deliverable

## Quantum Engineering Scoping Examples

### Example 1: Quantum Error Correction
**Too Broad:** "Improve quantum error correction"
**Too Narrow:** "Test surface code threshold with exactly 7 qubits"
**Well-Scoped:** "Demonstrate fault-tolerant logical gate operations on a distance-3 surface code using superconducting qubits, achieving logical error rates below physical error rates"

### Example 2: Quantum Sensing
**Too Broad:** "Develop quantum sensors"
**Too Narrow:** "Calibrate a single NV center magnetometer"
**Well-Scoped:** "Design and validate a multiplexed NV center magnetometer array achieving sub-nT sensitivity for neural imaging applications"

### Example 3: Quantum Algorithms
**Too Broad:** "Create quantum machine learning algorithms"
**Too Narrow:** "Run VQE for H2 molecule"
**Well-Scoped:** "Develop and benchmark a variational quantum algorithm for molecular dynamics simulation of small peptides (5-10 amino acids), demonstrating quantum advantage in energy landscape exploration"

## Deliverables

By end of Week 213, complete:

1. **Project_Scope.md** - Comprehensive scope document following template
2. **Success_Criteria.md** - Measurable success indicators and thresholds
3. **Scope Discussion Notes** - Documented feedback from advisor meeting

## Resources

### Required Reading
- Guide.md in this directory (comprehensive scoping methodology)
- Templates/Project_Scope.md (template with instructions)
- Templates/Success_Criteria.md (template with instructions)

### Additional Resources
- "The Craft of Research" - Chapter on research questions
- NIH grant scope definition guidelines
- Your department's PhD requirements document

## Common Pitfalls

### Scope Creep Indicators
- "While I'm at it, I could also..."
- "It would be nice to include..."
- Unbounded exploration without clear endpoints
- Adding features without removing others

### Under-Scoping Indicators
- "This is just a small contribution"
- Trivial results that don't advance the field
- Missing opportunities for meaningful impact
- Scope shrinks whenever challenges arise

### Scoping Balance
- Regular scope reviews with advisor
- Written scope document that requires formal change process
- Clear separation between core and extension work
- Time-boxed exploration phases

## Self-Assessment

At the end of Week 213, you should be able to answer:

- [ ] Can I explain my research scope in one sentence?
- [ ] Do I know exactly what my MVP deliverables are?
- [ ] Are my success criteria measurable and realistic?
- [ ] Have I explicitly stated what is out of scope?
- [ ] Does my advisor agree with my scope definition?
- [ ] Do I understand the resource requirements for MVP?

## Transition to Week 214

With scope clearly defined, Week 214 focuses on developing detailed timelines. A well-defined scope is essential for realistic timeline development—you can't schedule what you haven't defined.

*"The essence of strategy is choosing what not to do." — Michael Porter*

*This principle applies equally to research. Clear scope is not a limitation but a liberation—it focuses energy where it can have maximum impact.*
