# Week 215: Pilot Studies

## Overview

**Days:** 1499-1505
**Theme:** Preliminary Investigations and Methodology Validation
**Focus:** Conducting small-scale experiments to test assumptions and refine approaches

Week 215 transitions from planning to action through pilot studies. Pilot studies are small-scale preliminary investigations designed to test key assumptions, validate methodologies, and identify potential issues before committing to full-scale research execution. The insights gained this week directly inform the final project plan.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of Week 215, you will be able to:

1. Design effective pilot studies that test critical project assumptions
2. Execute small-scale experiments with appropriate documentation
3. Analyze pilot results to validate or refine methodology
4. Distinguish between signal and noise in preliminary data
5. Translate pilot findings into actionable project adjustments
6. Document lessons learned for future reference

## Key Concepts

### What is a Pilot Study?

A pilot study is a small-scale preliminary investigation conducted to:
- **Test feasibility** of proposed methods
- **Validate assumptions** underlying the research plan
- **Identify problems** before they become costly
- **Estimate parameters** (effect sizes, variability, timing)
- **Train researchers** on procedures and equipment

### Pilot Studies vs. Exploratory Research

| Aspect | Pilot Study | Exploratory Research |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|
| Goal | Validate specific assumptions | Discover patterns or phenomena |
| Scope | Narrow, focused | Broad, open-ended |
| Analysis | Confirmatory orientation | Hypothesis-generating |
| Sample size | Minimal for feasibility | Variable |
| Documentation | Process-focused | Finding-focused |

### Types of Pilot Studies

**Feasibility Pilots:**
- Can the proposed method be executed?
- Are resources sufficient?
- Is the timeline realistic?

**Measurement Pilots:**
- Do instruments work as expected?
- What is the measurement variability?
- Are calibrations stable?

**Protocol Pilots:**
- Are procedures clear and repeatable?
- What are common failure modes?
- How long do procedures actually take?

**Analysis Pilots:**
- Do analysis methods work with realistic data?
- Are computational resources sufficient?
- What are preliminary effect sizes?

### What Pilots Cannot Do

Pilot studies have important limitations:
- **Not for hypothesis testing:** Sample sizes too small for statistical power
- **Not generalizable:** Results may not scale to full study
- **Not definitive:** Negative results don't prove method won't work
- **Not publishable (usually):** Insufficient rigor for formal publication

## Quantum Engineering Pilot Study Examples

### Example 1: Qubit Coherence Measurement Pilot

**Assumption to Test:** T2 measurements can be completed within 2 hours per sample

**Pilot Design:**
- Measure T2 on 3 samples from different batches
- Track total time including setup, calibration, measurement, analysis
- Document any unexpected delays or issues

**Success Criteria:**
- Average total time per sample < 2.5 hours
- Measurement protocol completed without major issues
- T2 values within expected range (validate measurement setup)

### Example 2: Quantum Algorithm Implementation Pilot

**Assumption to Test:** VQE implementation can converge for target molecules

**Pilot Design:**
- Implement VQE for simple test case (H2 at equilibrium)
- Run on local simulator and cloud quantum hardware
- Track convergence behavior and computational resources

**Success Criteria:**
- Achieves known ground state energy within chemical accuracy
- Convergence within 100 iterations
- No critical software errors

### Example 3: Sample Preparation Pilot

**Assumption to Test:** Diamond surface preparation achieves required NV center density

**Pilot Design:**
- Prepare 5 diamond samples using proposed protocol
- Characterize NV density using confocal microscopy
- Measure T2 of selected NV centers

**Success Criteria:**
- NV density within 1-10 NV/um^2 in 4/5 samples
- At least 3 samples have NV centers with T2 > 100 us
- Protocol completed within 1 week

   - Execution notes and observations
   - Results and analysis
   - Implications for project plan

2. **Updated Project Plan** (if needed)
   - Methodology refinements
   - Timeline adjustments
   - Risk register updates

3. **Lessons Learned Document**
   - What worked well
   - What required adjustment
   - Recommendations for main study

## Common Pitfalls

### Over-Interpreting Results
- **Problem:** Drawing strong conclusions from small samples
- **Solution:** Focus on feasibility, not statistical significance

### Under-Documenting
- **Problem:** Rushing execution without recording details
- **Solution:** Document everything, including "obvious" observations

### Scope Creep
- **Problem:** Pilot expands into full study
- **Solution:** Define strict boundaries before starting

### Confirmation Bias
- **Problem:** Seeing only evidence that supports assumptions
- **Solution:** Actively seek disconfirming evidence

### Ignoring Negative Results
- **Problem:** Dismissing problems as "pilot issues"
- **Solution:** Take all results seriously, investigate problems

## Self-Assessment

At the end of Week 215, you should be able to answer:

- [ ] Did I identify the most critical assumptions to test?
- [ ] Did I design pilots that actually test these assumptions?
- [ ] Did I document execution thoroughly?
- [ ] Did I analyze results objectively?
- [ ] Did I translate findings into specific project adjustments?
- [ ] Have I updated my project plan based on pilot results?
- [ ] Am I confident in my methodology going forward?

## Transition to Week 216

With pilot studies complete and methodology validated, Week 216 focuses on finalizing all planning documents and completing the Semester 4A checklist. Pilot results should be integrated into the final project plan, and any remaining uncertainties should be acknowledged and addressed.

*"The goal is to fail fast, fail cheap, and fail smart. Pilots let you do all three before it matters."*

*Pilot studies are not a delay in starting research—they are the smart start to research. Time invested in validation now saves far more time in execution later.*
