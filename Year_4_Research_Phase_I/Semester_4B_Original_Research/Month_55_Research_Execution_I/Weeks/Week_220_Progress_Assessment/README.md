# Week 220: Progress Assessment

## Overview

**Days:** 1534-1540
**Theme:** Month 1 Checkpoint and Research Evaluation
**Goal:** Assess progress, document lessons learned, and plan Month 2

## Week Purpose

Week 220 concludes Month 55 with a comprehensive assessment of your first month of active research. This critical checkpoint evaluates progress against your original research plan, identifies lessons learned, documents preliminary findings, and sets the direction for Month 2. Honest self-assessment now prevents compounding problems later.

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this week, you will:

1. Critically evaluate Month 1 progress against original objectives
2. Document lessons learned about methodology and research process
3. Compile preliminary findings into a coherent narrative
4. Identify necessary adjustments to research plan
5. Create an updated timeline for Month 2 and beyond

## Notes

This week is about honest reflection and strategic planning. The goal is not to report perfection but to understand reality and plan effectively. Key principles:

1. **Honesty:** Accurate assessment enables good decisions
2. **Constructiveness:** Focus on solutions, not just problems
3. **Specificity:** Vague plans lead to vague results
4. **Flexibility:** Adjust plans based on learning
5. **Communication:** Keep advisor informed and aligned

Remember that research rarely proceeds exactly as planned. The mark of a good researcher is not perfect prediction but effective adaptation.

**Week Mantra:** "Know where you are to plan where you're going."
