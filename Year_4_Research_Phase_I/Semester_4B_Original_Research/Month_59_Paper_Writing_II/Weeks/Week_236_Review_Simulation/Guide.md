# Review Simulation Methodology Guide

## Introduction

This guide provides comprehensive methodology for self-reviewing your manuscript with the critical eye of a journal referee. The ability to anticipate and address reviewer concerns before submission significantly improves acceptance rates and reduces revision cycles.

## Part I: Understanding the Review Process

### How Peer Review Works

**The typical workflow:**

```
Submission → Editorial Screening → Reviewer Assignment → Review
                     ↓                                      ↓
                  Desk Reject                         Report Submitted
                     ↓                                      ↓
                   END                            Editorial Decision
                                                         ↓
                                    ┌─────────────────────┼─────────────────────┐
                                    ↓                     ↓                     ↓
                                 Reject              Revise               Accept
                                    ↓                     ↓                     ↓
                                   END              Revision              Publish
                                                         ↓
                                                  Re-review
                                                         ↓
                                              Accept / Reject / Re-revise
```

**Key insight:** Most papers require revision. Preparing for this reality improves outcomes.

### What Editors Look For

**Initial screening criteria:**

1. **Scope:** Does this fit the journal?
2. **Quality threshold:** Is this potentially publishable?
3. **Presentation:** Is it comprehensible?
4. **Originality:** Is there something new?

**Desk rejection triggers:**
- Clearly out of scope
- Insufficient novelty (obvious to editor)
- Major presentation problems
- Ethical concerns (plagiarism, duplicate submission)

### What Reviewers Evaluate

**Primary evaluation dimensions:**

| Dimension | Questions |
|-----------|-----------|
| **Significance** | Does this advance the field? Will it impact future research? |
| **Novelty** | What's new? How does it differ from prior work? |
| **Technical quality** | Is the methodology sound? Are controls adequate? |
| **Rigor** | Is analysis thorough? Are statistics appropriate? |
| **Presentation** | Is it clear? Well-organized? Appropriate length? |
| **Reproducibility** | Could I repeat this? Are details sufficient? |

**Reviewer psychology:**
- Experts look for mistakes in their specialty
- Non-experts look for accessibility and clarity
- Everyone looks for overclaiming
- Time-pressed reviewers notice obvious problems first

### Types of Reviewers

**Reviewer archetypes:**

1. **The Expert:** Deep knowledge, spots subtle errors, may demand more
2. **The Generalist:** Broader perspective, focuses on clarity and significance
3. **The Competitor:** Works in same area, may be skeptical or territorial
4. **The Junior Reviewer:** Thorough, may follow checklist closely
5. **The Busy Professor:** Quick review, focuses on big issues only

Your self-review should consider all perspectives.

## Part II: The Self-Review Process

### Phase 1: Fresh Eyes Preparation

Before reviewing, create distance from your work:

1. **Time gap:** Wait at least 2-3 days after last edit
2. **Format change:** Print on paper or view on different screen
3. **Context shift:** Review in different location than where you wrote
4. **Mindset shift:** Explicitly adopt reviewer perspective

**Mental preparation:**
> "I am a reviewer with limited time. I'm looking for reasons to recommend rejection, not reasons to accept. The authors must prove their claims to me."

### Phase 2: First Pass - Quick Assessment

**Simulate how a reviewer first encounters your paper:**

**Step 1: Title and Abstract (2 minutes)**
- Is the title clear and accurate?
- Does the abstract stand alone?
- What are my expectations for the paper?
- Am I interested in reading more?

**Step 2: Figures Only (5 minutes)**
- Examine each figure without reading caption
- Can I understand what's shown?
- Do figures tell a coherent story?
- Any obvious problems?

**Step 3: Section Scan (5 minutes)**
- Skim introduction for context and contribution
- Skim conclusions for claims
- Do they match?

**After first pass:**
Write down your initial impression (positive/negative) and any immediate concerns.

### Phase 3: Detailed Critical Reading

**Section-by-section analysis:**

### Phase 4: Specific Attacks

**Deliberately try to find problems:**

**Novelty attack:**
- List all prior work that does anything similar
- For each, articulate exactly how your work differs
- Is the difference significant?

**Methodology attack:**
- What could go wrong in your experiment/calculation?
- What assumptions are you making?
- What controls are missing?
- What alternative approaches would be better?

**Statistics attack:**
- Are error bars meaningful?
- Are sample sizes adequate?
- Is statistical analysis appropriate?
- Are confidence levels stated?

**Interpretation attack:**
- What alternative explanations exist for your data?
- What would disprove your interpretation?
- Are you cherry-picking favorable results?
- Are limitations understated?

**Presentation attack:**
- What's confusing?
- What's too long?
- What's missing?
- What's redundant?

### Phase 5: Writing the Mock Review

## Part III: Addressing Concerns

### Prioritizing Issues

**Categorization matrix:**

|  | Can Fix Now | Cannot Fix Now |
|--|-------------|----------------|
| **Critical (blocks acceptance)** | Highest priority | Document, consider implications |
| **Serious (likely objection)** | High priority | Prepare strong response |
| **Minor (improvement)** | Medium priority | Fix if time allows |
| **Cosmetic** | Low priority | Quick fixes |

### Response Strategies by Issue Type

#### "This has been done before"

**Preparation:**
1. Know all relevant prior work thoroughly
2. Articulate exact differences from each
3. Quantify improvements where possible
4. Cite prior work appropriately

**Response template:**
> "We thank the reviewer for raising this point. We are aware of [prior work] and have cited it [reference]. Our work differs in [specific ways]: [list]. These differences lead to [specific improvements/new capabilities]: [quantify]. We have clarified this distinction in the revised manuscript [location]."

#### "The control experiment is missing"

**Preparation:**
1. List all possible controls
2. Determine which are feasible
3. Perform missing controls if possible
4. Prepare justification if not

**Response template:**
> "We agree this control would strengthen the paper. [If done]: We have performed this additional measurement and include it in [location]. [If not possible]: Unfortunately, this measurement is not feasible because [reason]. However, we note that [alternative evidence] supports our conclusion. We have added discussion of this limitation [location]."

#### "The statistics are not rigorous"

**Preparation:**
1. Know what statistical tests were used and why
2. Verify assumptions are met
3. Consider alternatives
4. Consult statistician if needed

**Response template:**
> "We appreciate this concern about statistical rigor. We used [test] because [justification]. We have [added/clarified] the statistical methodology in [location], including [specific improvements]. We confirm that [assumptions] are met and have added [verification, e.g., normality tests]."

#### "Claims are too strong"

**Preparation:**
1. Identify all strong claims
2. Assess evidence level for each
3. Prepare to either strengthen evidence or weaken claims

**Response template:**
> "We thank the reviewer for this comment. Upon reflection, we agree that [specific claim] was overstated given the current evidence. We have revised the language to [new wording] in [location]. The modified claim is now appropriately supported by [evidence]."

#### "Important prior work is not cited"

**Preparation:**
1. Conduct thorough literature search
2. Have good reasons for citation choices
3. Add missing citations if appropriate

**Response template:**
> "We thank the reviewer for bringing this work to our attention. [If oversight]: We have added [reference] and discuss its relevance in [location]. [If deliberate omission]: We appreciate this suggestion but believe [reference] is not directly relevant because [reason]. However, we have added [alternative reference] which addresses a similar point."

### The Response Letter

**Structure:**

```markdown

## Part V: Common Pitfalls

### Self-Review Pitfalls

**Too easy on yourself:**
- You know what you meant, so you read past unclear writing
- You unconsciously skip weaknesses you don't want to find
- You give yourself benefit of the doubt

**Solution:** Have someone else review too, or wait longer between writing and reviewing.

**Too harsh on yourself:**
- You lose confidence and delay submission indefinitely
- You rewrite endlessly without improvement
- You dismiss valid work as insufficient

**Solution:** Set clear criteria and submission deadline. "Good enough" is better than "perpetually improving."

### Response Letter Pitfalls

**Defensive tone:**
- "The reviewer clearly misunderstood..."
- "This criticism is unfair because..."
- "We disagree with this assessment."

**Better:** "We thank the reviewer... We have clarified..."

**Ignoring concerns:**
- Not responding to every point
- Vague responses without specific changes
- Claiming to have addressed concerns without actually doing so

**Better:** Address every point explicitly, make specific changes, or explain why change is not appropriate.

**Overpromising:**
- Agreeing to changes you cannot make
- Claiming improvements not reflected in manuscript
- Committing to additional experiments you can't complete

**Better:** Be honest about what you can and cannot do.
