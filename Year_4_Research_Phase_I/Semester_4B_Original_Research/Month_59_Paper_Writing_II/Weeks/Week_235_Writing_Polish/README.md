### The Philosophy of Line Editing

#### Why Line Editing Matters

Clear writing reflects clear thinking. If readers struggle to parse your sentences, they may doubt the rigor of your science. Line editing removes barriers between your ideas and the reader's understanding.

**The goal:** Prose that is invisible—readers absorb your ideas without noticing the writing.

#### The Editing Mindset

**First draft you:** Generative, exploratory, focused on getting ideas down
**Editing you:** Critical, precise, focused on reader experience

These require different mental modes. Create separation:
- Time separation (wait 24-48 hours between writing and editing)
- Format separation (edit on paper or different screen)
- Role separation (pretend you're editing someone else's work)

### Key Concepts

#### 1. The Clarity Hierarchy

Address in this order:

```
1. Word choice (right word for meaning)
      ↓
2. Sentence structure (clear syntax)
      ↓
3. Paragraph structure (logical development)
      ↓
4. Section flow (coherent narrative)
```

Issues at higher levels can cause problems at lower levels. If a paragraph is unclear, fixing individual sentences may be futile—the paragraph structure may need revision.

#### 2. Scientific Writing Principles

| Principle | Application | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **Precision** | Use exact terms | "increased" → "increased by 15%" |
| **Objectivity** | Avoid subjective claims | "dramatically improved" → "improved by a factor of 3" |
| **Parsimony** | Use fewest words needed | "in order to" → "to" |
| **Consistency** | Same term for same concept | Don't switch between "fidelity" and "accuracy" |
| **Active voice** | Subject performs action | "We measured" not "Measurements were made" |

#### 3. Common Problems in Scientific Writing

**Hedging excess:**
- "It might be possible that perhaps the effect could be due to..."
- Better: "The effect is likely due to..." or "We attribute the effect to..."

**Noun strings:**
- "superconducting qubit two-level system energy relaxation rate measurement"
- Better: "measurement of the energy relaxation rate in superconducting qubits"

**Passive voice overuse:**
- "The sample was prepared and then was measured and the results were analyzed"
- Better: "We prepared the sample, measured it, and analyzed the results"

**Jargon without definition:**
- "We used RB to characterize the CZ gate in our transmon-based QPU"
- Better: Define acronyms on first use; explain technical terms

### Editing Techniques

#### The Four Reading Passes

**Pass 1: Content Focus**
Read for meaning. Does each sentence say what you intend?
- Mark unclear sentences
- Note missing information
- Identify unsupported claims

**Pass 2: Structure Focus**
Read for organization. Does information flow logically?
- Check topic sentences
- Verify transitions
- Assess paragraph length

**Pass 3: Language Focus**
Read for style. Is language precise and professional?
- Identify passive voice
- Find weak verbs
- Spot redundancy

**Pass 4: Mechanics Focus**
Read for correctness. Are grammar, spelling, citations correct?
- Check subject-verb agreement
- Verify reference format
- Confirm number consistency

#### The Sentence-Level Audit

For each sentence, ask:
1. Is this sentence necessary?
2. Does it say exactly what I mean?
3. Is it as short as possible without losing meaning?
4. Is the most important information prominent?
5. Does it connect to surrounding sentences?

#### The Paragraph Audit

For each paragraph, check:
1. **Topic sentence:** States the paragraph's main point (usually first sentence)
2. **Support:** All sentences support the topic
3. **Coherence:** Sentences connect logically
4. **Necessity:** Paragraph contributes to section
5. **Length:** Not too long (aim for 3-6 sentences in science writing)

### Common Fixes

#### Fix 1: Strengthen Weak Verbs

| Weak | Strong |
|------|--------|
| is/was/were | *use active verb* |
| make/made | create, generate, produce |
| do/does/did | perform, execute, conduct |
| get/got | obtain, achieve, acquire |
| have/has/had | possess, exhibit, display |
| show | demonstrate, reveal, indicate |

**Example:**
- Before: "The data show that there is an increase in fidelity"
- After: "The data reveal a fidelity increase" or "Fidelity increased (Fig. 2)"

#### Fix 2: Eliminate Redundancy

| Redundant | Concise |
|-----------|---------|
| completely eliminate | eliminate |
| end result | result |
| future plans | plans |
| past history | history |
| basic fundamentals | fundamentals |
| new innovation | innovation |
| close proximity | proximity |
| absolutely essential | essential |

**Phrase redundancy:**
- "In the event that" → "If"
- "Due to the fact that" → "Because"
- "In order to" → "To"
- "At the present time" → "Now" / "Currently"
- "For the purpose of" → "For" / "To"

#### Fix 3: Convert Passive to Active

**Passive:** "The qubit was measured by us using dispersive readout"
**Active:** "We measured the qubit using dispersive readout"

**When passive is appropriate:**
- Agent unknown or unimportant: "The sample was damaged during shipping"
- Agent obvious: "The samples were stored at 4 K" (obviously by researchers)
- Emphasis on action: "This effect was first observed in 1995"

#### Fix 4: Clarify Pronoun References

**Unclear:** "When the qubit decoheres, it affects the gate. This is a major problem."
("This" could refer to decoherence, the effect, or the gate)

**Clear:** "When the qubit decoheres, it reduces gate fidelity. This decoherence-induced error is a major problem."

**Rule:** Every pronoun should have an unambiguous antecedent.

#### Fix 5: Maintain Parallel Structure

**Not parallel:** "We characterized the qubit, measured its coherence, and a gate was calibrated"

**Parallel:** "We characterized the qubit, measured its coherence, and calibrated a gate"

Lists should have consistent grammatical structure.

### Technical Writing Specifics

#### Numbers and Units

**Rules:**
- Spell out numbers below 10 unless with units: "three qubits" but "3 mK"
- Use SI units or field-standard equivalents
- Space between number and unit: "10 μs" not "10μs"
- Use proper symbols: "μ" not "u", "Ω" not "ohm" (in equations)

#### Equations

**Integration:**
- Equations are part of sentences—they need punctuation
- Introduce equations: "The Hamiltonian is given by" followed by equation
- Define all variables when first introduced
- Reference equations by number: "Equation (3)" or "Eq. (3)"

#### Abbreviations and Acronyms

**Rules:**
- Define on first use: "quantum error correction (QEC)"
- After definition, use abbreviation consistently
- Common abbreviations may not need definition (e.g., DNA)
- Journal-specific conventions may apply

#### Citations

**Placement:**
- Citations go after the claim, before the period: "...as shown previously [1]."
- Multiple citations: "[1-3]" or "[1, 2, 3]" depending on journal
- Self-citation: Use sparingly and appropriately

**Common errors:**
- Citing reviews instead of primary sources
- Missing recent relevant work
- Incorrect citation format for journal
