# Writing Polish Methodology Guide

## Introduction

This guide provides systematic strategies for line-level editing of scientific manuscripts. Good scientific writing is invisible—readers focus on ideas, not prose. Achieving this invisibility requires careful attention to clarity, precision, and flow at every level of the text.

## Part I: The Science of Clear Writing

### Cognitive Load and Reading

Readers have limited cognitive resources. Every unclear sentence consumes resources that should be devoted to understanding your science.

**Cognitive load factors:**
- Sentence complexity (length, nested clauses)
- Unfamiliar vocabulary
- Ambiguous references
- Inconsistent terminology
- Poor organization

**The goal:** Minimize extraneous cognitive load so readers can focus on your ideas.

### The Given-New Contract

Effective sentences follow the **given-new pattern:**
1. Begin with familiar information ("given")
2. End with new information ("new")

**Example violating given-new:**
> "A 99.5% fidelity was achieved by our two-qubit gate."

(New information comes first; reader has to hold it while processing)

**Corrected (given-new):**
> "Our two-qubit gate achieved a 99.5% fidelity."

(Familiar subject first, new result at end)

### Stress Position

English sentences have a **stress position** at the end. Place your most important information there.

**Weak stress position:**
> "The fidelity, surprisingly, exceeded 99%, which represents a significant improvement over previous work."

(Main point buried in middle; weak ending)

**Strong stress position:**
> "Surprisingly, the fidelity exceeded 99%—a significant improvement over previous work."

(Key comparison emphasized at end)

## Part II: Sentence-Level Editing

### Sentence Types and Variety

**Simple sentences:** One independent clause
> "We measured the coherence time."

**Compound sentences:** Two independent clauses joined by conjunction
> "We measured the coherence time, and we found unexpected oscillations."

**Complex sentences:** Independent clause + dependent clause
> "When we measured the coherence time, we found unexpected oscillations."

**Compound-complex:** Multiple clauses of both types
> "Although the theory predicted a simple decay, when we measured the coherence time, we found unexpected oscillations that persisted for over 100 μs."

**Best practice:** Vary sentence types. Too many simple sentences sound choppy; too many complex sentences become tiring.

### Sentence Length Guidelines

| Sentence Length | Effect | Best For |
|-----------------|--------|----------|
| < 15 words | Punchy, emphatic | Key results, transitions |
| 15-25 words | Standard, readable | Most content |
| 25-35 words | Detailed, flowing | Complex explanations |
| > 35 words | Dense, potentially unclear | Rarely appropriate |

**Vary length strategically:** A short sentence after several long ones creates emphasis.

### Eliminating Wordy Phrases

| Wordy | Concise | Savings |
|-------|---------|---------|
| It is important to note that | Note that / Importantly, | 3-4 words |
| In the event that | If | 3 words |
| Due to the fact that | Because | 4 words |
| In order to | To | 2 words |
| At the present time | Now / Currently | 3 words |
| For the purpose of | For / To | 3 words |
| With regard to | Regarding / About | 2 words |
| In a manner similar to | Like | 4 words |
| Despite the fact that | Although | 3 words |
| In the absence of | Without | 3 words |
| A large number of | Many | 3 words |
| A sufficient number of | Enough | 3 words |
| Has the ability to | Can | 3 words |
| Make use of | Use | 2 words |
| It is possible that | Possibly / May | 3 words |
| It should be noted that | Note that | 3 words |
| As a consequence of | Because of | 2 words |
| In close proximity to | Near | 3 words |
| For the reason that | Because | 3 words |
| In light of the fact that | Since / Because | 5 words |

**Cumulative impact:** A paper might have hundreds of these phrases. Fixing them can reduce length by 10-20% while improving clarity.

### Verb Strength

Verbs carry the action of sentences. Strong, specific verbs energize prose.

**Verb strength hierarchy:**
1. **Strongest:** Active, specific (demonstrate, reveal, inhibit)
2. **Moderate:** Active, general (show, make, get)
3. **Weak:** Being verbs (is, was, were)
4. **Weakest:** Nominalizations (provide an indication → indicate)

**Nominalization problem:**
Turning verbs into nouns weakens prose and adds words.

| Nominalization | Verb Form |
|----------------|-----------|
| make a measurement of | measure |
| provide an explanation for | explain |
| conduct an investigation of | investigate |
| make an observation that | observe |
| reach a conclusion that | conclude |
| make a contribution to | contribute to |
| perform an analysis of | analyze |
| have a dependence on | depend on |

### Active vs. Passive Voice

**Active voice:** Subject performs action
> "We measured the gate fidelity."

**Passive voice:** Subject receives action
> "The gate fidelity was measured."

**When to use active:**
- Describing your methods: "We characterized..."
- Presenting your results: "Our data show..."
- Making claims: "This demonstrates..."

**When passive is acceptable:**
- Agent unknown: "The sample was contaminated."
- Agent obvious: "Samples were stored at 4 K."
- Emphasis on object: "Three qubits were tested."

**General guideline:** Prefer active voice; use passive deliberately.

### Parallel Structure

Items in a series should have the same grammatical form.

**Not parallel:**
> "We characterized the qubits, measured coherence times, and a two-qubit gate was calibrated."

(First two items are active; third is passive)

**Parallel:**
> "We characterized the qubits, measured coherence times, and calibrated a two-qubit gate."

**Apply to:**
- Lists (numbered or bulleted)
- Compound predicates
- Correlative conjunctions (both...and, either...or, not only...but also)

## Part III: Paragraph-Level Editing

### The Topic Sentence

Every paragraph should have a **topic sentence** stating its main point—usually the first sentence.

**Test:** Read only topic sentences. They should form a coherent summary of the section.

**Example of effective topic sentences:**

```
1. "Superconducting qubits suffer from several decoherence mechanisms."
   [Support: description of mechanisms]

2. "The dominant source of decoherence in our system is quasiparticle poisoning."
   [Support: evidence for this claim]

3. "We addressed quasiparticle poisoning by implementing normal-metal traps."
   [Support: description of solution]

4. "This approach reduced the decoherence rate by a factor of five."
   [Support: quantitative evidence]
```

Reading just these sentences tells a story.

### Paragraph Coherence

**Coherence devices:**

1. **Repetition:** Repeat key terms for consistency
2. **Pronouns:** Refer back to established concepts
3. **Transitional phrases:** Signal relationships
4. **Parallel structure:** Similar sentences for similar ideas

**Example of coherent paragraph:**

> "The primary limitation of superconducting qubits is decoherence. **This decoherence** arises from interactions with environmental degrees of freedom. **Such interactions** include photon loss, quasiparticle tunneling, and fluctuating defects. **Of these mechanisms**, quasiparticle tunneling dominates in our samples. **This dominance** is evidenced by the temperature dependence shown in Figure 2."

(Bold shows coherence devices)

### Paragraph Length

**Guidelines:**
- 3-6 sentences typical for science writing
- Very long paragraphs (>8 sentences) may need splitting
- Very short paragraphs (1-2 sentences) should be rare, used for emphasis

**When to start new paragraph:**
- New topic or subtopic
- New speaker (in quoted material)
- New chronological stage
- Shift in logic (e.g., from general to specific)

### Transitions Between Paragraphs

**Types of transitional words/phrases:**

| Relationship | Examples |
|--------------|----------|
| Addition | Furthermore, Moreover, Additionally, In addition |
| Contrast | However, Nevertheless, In contrast, Conversely |
| Cause/Effect | Therefore, Consequently, Thus, As a result |
| Illustration | For example, Specifically, In particular |
| Sequence | First, Subsequently, Finally, Then |
| Summary | In summary, Overall, In conclusion |
| Emphasis | Indeed, In fact, Importantly |

**Placement:** Transition words usually appear at the start of paragraphs but can be placed mid-sentence for flow.

**Caution:** Don't overuse. Not every paragraph needs an explicit transition word if the connection is clear.

## Part IV: Technical Precision

### Consistent Terminology

**Rule:** Use the same term for the same concept throughout.

**Problem:** Switching between synonyms causes confusion.
> "The gate fidelity improved. This accuracy increase..."

(Is "accuracy" the same as "fidelity"? Reader unsure.)

**Solution:** Choose one term and use it consistently. Define it if necessary.

### Precise Quantification

**Vague quantifiers to avoid:**

| Vague | Replace With |
|-------|--------------|
| several | specify: three, five, etc. |
| many | specify: dozens, hundreds |
| few | specify: two, three |
| some | specify: approximately 20% |
| significant | statistically or specify magnitude |
| dramatically | specify: by a factor of 10 |
| recently | specify: in 2023, last year |
| quickly | specify: in 10 ns |

**Claim calibration:**

| Evidence Level | Appropriate Language |
|----------------|---------------------|
| Proven | demonstrates, proves, shows |
| Strong evidence | indicates, reveals, suggests strongly |
| Moderate evidence | suggests, is consistent with |
| Weak evidence | may, might, could |
| Speculation | we speculate, we hypothesize |

### Mathematical Notation

**Consistency checklist:**
- [ ] Same symbol for same quantity throughout
- [ ] All symbols defined on first use
- [ ] Units included where appropriate
- [ ] Vectors/matrices distinguished (bold, arrows)
- [ ] Complex numbers marked if ambiguous
- [ ] Operators identified

**Equation integration:**
Equations are parts of sentences. They need punctuation.

**Incorrect:**
> "The Hamiltonian is
>
> $$H = \omega a^\dagger a$$
>
> where ω is the frequency."

**Correct:**
> "The Hamiltonian is
>
> $$H = \omega a^\dagger a,$$
>
> where $\omega$ is the frequency."

(Comma after equation, "where" lowercase)

### Citation Accuracy

**Verify:**
- Correct paper cited for claimed result
- Page/figure numbers if referencing specific data
- Author names spelled correctly
- Journal format matches target journal style

**Common errors:**
- Citing reviews instead of primary sources
- Outdated citations (newer, more relevant work exists)
- Self-citation bias (cite your work appropriately, not excessively)

## Part V: Style Refinement

### Voice and Tone

**Scientific tone:**
- Confident but not arrogant
- Precise but not pedantic
- Objective but not robotic

**Avoid:**
- Excessive hedging: "It might be possible that perhaps..."
- Overclaiming: "This groundbreaking discovery proves..."
- Colloquialisms: "This worked like a charm"
- First-person avoidance syndrome: "The authors believe..."

**Appropriate first person:**
> "We present..." "Our results show..." "We conclude..."

### Emphasis Techniques

**Methods of emphasis:**
1. **Position:** End of sentence/paragraph for stress
2. **Short sentences:** Stand out after longer ones
3. **Colons:** Introduce important information
4. **Dashes:** Create interruption for emphasis
5. **Repetition:** Strategic repetition signals importance

**Example combining techniques:**
> "Prior approaches achieved modest improvements—typically 10-20%. Our method achieved an improvement of 150%: the largest ever reported."

### Avoiding Repetition

**Problem:** Same word repeated too frequently

**Solution options:**
1. Use pronouns (it, they, this + noun)
2. Use synonyms sparingly (only if meaning is truly equivalent)
3. Restructure sentences to eliminate need for repetition
4. Combine sentences

**Example:**
> "The qubit showed coherence. The qubit's coherence time was 50 μs. We improved the qubit's coherence by..."

**Revised:**
> "The qubit showed a coherence time of 50 μs. We improved this coherence by..."

## Part VI: Common Errors in Physics Writing

### The "It is...that" Construction

**Wordy:** "It is clear that the effect is temperature-dependent."
**Direct:** "The effect is clearly temperature-dependent."

**Wordy:** "It was found that the gate fidelity exceeded 99%."
**Direct:** "The gate fidelity exceeded 99%."

### Dangling Modifiers

**Error:** "By increasing the drive amplitude, the fidelity improved."
(Who increased the amplitude? Not the fidelity.)

**Correct:** "By increasing the drive amplitude, we improved the fidelity."

**Error:** "Measuring at low temperatures, the noise was reduced."
**Correct:** "When we measured at low temperatures, the noise was reduced."

### Which vs. That

**That:** Introduces restrictive (essential) clauses
> "The qubit that showed the longest coherence was selected."

(Only that specific qubit was selected; clause restricts meaning)

**Which:** Introduces non-restrictive (additional) clauses
> "The qubit, which had been fabricated last month, showed excellent coherence."

(Additional information, not essential to identify the qubit; set off with commas)

### Singular vs. Plural

**Problem:** Data
> "The data shows..." ← Incorrect (data is plural)
> "The data show..." ← Correct

**Problem:** Each/Every
> "Each of the qubits were measured" ← Incorrect
> "Each of the qubits was measured" ← Correct

**Problem:** Collective nouns
> "The team are..." ← British English
> "The team is..." ← American English (choose one, be consistent)

## Part VII: Proofreading Strategies

### Multi-Pass Approach

**Pass 1:** Content and meaning (read for sense)
**Pass 2:** Structure and flow (read for organization)
**Pass 3:** Language and style (read for clarity)
**Pass 4:** Mechanics (read for errors)

Each pass has one focus. Trying to catch everything at once means catching less.

### Reading Aloud

Reading aloud catches errors that silent reading misses:
- Awkward phrasing
- Missing words
- Repetition
- Overly long sentences

If you can't read a sentence in one breath, it's too long.

### Reverse Reading

For catching typos, read backwards:
1. Start at the last sentence
2. Read each sentence in isolation
3. Move to the previous sentence

This breaks the narrative flow, making errors more visible.

### Fresh Eyes

After intensive writing, you become blind to your text. Solutions:
- Wait 24-48 hours before editing
- Change the font or format
- Print on paper
- Have a colleague read it
