### Key Presentation Principles

**Tell a Story:**
- Beginning: Why this problem matters
- Middle: What you did and found
- End: Where this is going

**Be Visual:**
- One key message per slide
- Figures should stand alone
- Minimize text, maximize impact

**Know Your Audience:**
- Committee members have diverse expertise
- Explain specialized concepts
- Connect to broader context

**Be Honest:**
- Acknowledge limitations
- Don't oversell results
- Uncertainty is acceptable; dishonesty is not

### Anticipating Questions

**Standard Committee Questions:**

| Category | Example Questions |
|----------|-------------------|
| Motivation | Why is this important? Who cares? |
| Methods | Why this approach? What are alternatives? |
| Results | How confident are you? What could be wrong? |
| Interpretation | What does this mean? How does it connect? |
| Future | How will you complete this? What's the timeline? |
| Bigger picture | How does this advance the field? |

**Challenging Questions to Prepare For:**

1. "What if your main hypothesis is wrong?"
2. "Why should we believe this result?"
3. "What's the biggest weakness of your work?"
4. "How is this different from [related work]?"
5. "What would you do differently if starting over?"

## Committee Meeting Dynamics

### The Committee's Perspective

Committee members are evaluating:

| Criterion | What They Look For |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Research quality | Rigor, reproducibility, significance |
| Student progress | Appropriate development for stage |
| Feasibility | Can this be completed in time? |
| Independence | Making decisions without hand-holding |
| Scientific communication | Clear explanation of complex ideas |
| Critical thinking | Understanding of limitations |

### Managing the Q&A

**When You Know the Answer:**
- Be clear and concise
- Provide evidence for claims
- Connect to broader context

**When You Don't Know:**
- Acknowledge honestly: "I haven't investigated that yet"
- Offer how you would find out
- Never bluff

**When the Question is Unclear:**
- Ask for clarification
- Paraphrase to confirm understanding
- Then answer the clarified question

**When Receiving Criticism:**
- Listen fully before responding
- Acknowledge valid points
- Explain your reasoning calmly
- Thank the committee member

### Post-Meeting Actions

After the review:

1. **Immediately document** - Write down all questions and feedback
2. **Categorize feedback** - Critical, important, nice-to-have
3. **Create action items** - Specific tasks with deadlines
4. **Follow up** - Thank committee, address any outstanding items
5. **Integrate** - Incorporate feedback into research plan

## Documentation Standards

### Mid-Project Review Report

The formal written report should include:

1. **Executive Summary** (1 page)
2. **Introduction and Background** (2-3 pages)
3. **Research Progress** (5-10 pages)
4. **Validation and Quality Assurance** (2-3 pages)
5. **Novel Findings** (1-2 pages)
6. **Discussion and Limitations** (2-3 pages)
7. **Future Work Plan** (2-3 pages)
8. **Timeline and Milestones** (1 page)
9. **References**
10. **Appendices** (as needed)

### Progress Metrics

Quantify progress where possible:

| Metric | Baseline | Current | Target | Status |
|--------|----------|---------|--------|--------|
| Objectives completed | 0 | X | Y | On track / Behind |
| Experiments performed | 0 | X | Y | |
| Validation tests passed | 0 | X | Y | |
| Papers drafted | 0 | X | Y | |

## Self-Assessment Framework

### Research Progress

| Area | Self-Rating (1-5) | Evidence |
|------|-------------------|----------|
| Technical depth | | |
| Breadth of approach | | |
| Quality of results | | |
| Documentation | | |
| Time management | | |

### Research Skills

| Skill | Beginning | Now | Evidence of Growth |
|-------|-----------|-----|-------------------|
| Experimental design | | | |
| Data analysis | | | |
| Scientific writing | | | |
| Presentation | | | |
| Problem-solving | | | |

### Independence Indicators

- [ ] Can design experiments without guidance
- [ ] Can troubleshoot problems independently
- [ ] Can evaluate own results critically
- [ ] Can make and defend research decisions
- [ ] Can identify and pursue novel directions
- [ ] Can communicate research to various audiences

## Common Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Prevention |
|---------|------------|
| Trying to cover everything | Focus on key results |
| Too much detail | Match detail to audience |
| Hiding weaknesses | Address limitations directly |
| Unrealistic timelines | Build in contingencies |
| Defensive responses | Accept feedback gracefully |
| Poor time management | Practice, practice, practice |

## Connection to Year 4 Progression

The mid-project review is a critical checkpoint:

**If Going Well:**
- Continue with refined plan
- Potentially accelerate ambitious goals
- Consider additional directions

**If Challenges Identified:**
- Develop mitigation strategies
- Adjust scope if necessary
- Increase meeting frequency with advisor

**For All Cases:**
- Document lessons learned
- Update risk assessment
- Strengthen weak areas

## Self-Check Questions

Before the review, verify:

- [ ] All major results compiled and organized?
- [ ] Presentation complete and practiced?
- [ ] Backup slides prepared?
- [ ] Common questions anticipated?
- [ ] Timeline to completion realistic?
- [ ] Mid-Project Review Report drafted?
- [ ] Logistics arranged (room, AV, timing)?
