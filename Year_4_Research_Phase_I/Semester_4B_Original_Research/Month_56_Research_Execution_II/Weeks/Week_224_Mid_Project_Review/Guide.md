## Part 2: Synthesis and Narrative Development

### 2.1 From Results to Story

Research produces many disparate findings. The mid-project review requires weaving these into a coherent narrative.

**The Narrative Arc:**

### 2.2 Connecting Results to Objectives

Map every result back to original objectives:

| Original Objective | Status | Key Results | Implications |
|-------------------|--------|-------------|--------------|
| Objective 1 | Complete | Result A, B | Validated hypothesis |
| Objective 2 | Partial | Result C | Need more data |
| Objective 3 | Not started | - | Planned for next phase |
| Unexpected | Emerged | Result D | Opens new direction |

### 2.3 Addressing the Unexpected

When results differ from expectations, explain:

1. **What was expected** and why
2. **What was observed** and how confidently
3. **Why the difference** (if known)
4. **What this means** for the research

**Example Framework:**

```markdown
We hypothesized that coherence time would scale as 1/n due to independent
noise sources. Instead, we observed 1/n^1.5 scaling with high confidence
(R² = 0.98). This suggests correlated noise contributions, possibly from
[mechanism]. We are investigating this through [approach], which may reveal
[implication].
```

### 2.4 The Limitations Discussion

Every research project has limitations. Discussing them demonstrates maturity:

**Types of Limitations:**

| Type | Example | How to Address |
|------|---------|----------------|
| Scope | Only tested one qubit type | Generalization planned |
| Resolution | Limited by measurement noise | UQ quantifies impact |
| Validity | Model approximations | Validation tests bound errors |
| Resources | Time/equipment constraints | Prioritized critical experiments |

## Part 3: Presentation Development

### 3.1 Slide Design Principles

**The 1-7-7 Rule:**
- 1 main message per slide
- Maximum 7 bullets
- Maximum 7 words per bullet

**Visual Hierarchy:**
1. Title: Tells the slide's conclusion
2. Figure/diagram: Provides evidence
3. Caption/notes: Explains details

**Example Slide Transformation:**

Bad:
```
Title: Results of Coherence Measurements

• We measured coherence times for 15 different parameter combinations
• The measurements were performed using a standard Ramsey sequence
• T2* ranged from 10 to 150 microseconds depending on conditions
• The longest coherence was achieved at low temperature and low power
• Statistical analysis showed significant dependence on temperature
• Power dependence was weaker but still statistically significant
• These results suggest thermal noise is the dominant mechanism
```

Good:
```
Title: Coherence Limited by Thermal Noise, Not Drive Power

[FIGURE: T2 vs Temperature plot showing clear 1/T trend]
[FIGURE: T2 vs Power plot showing weak dependence]

Caption: T2 shows 10x stronger dependence on temperature (left) than
drive power (right), indicating thermal noise dominates.
```

### 3.2 Figure Guidelines

**Figure Checklist:**
- [ ] Axes labeled with units
- [ ] Font size readable from back of room
- [ ] Legend doesn't obscure data
- [ ] Color-blind friendly palette
- [ ] Error bars or confidence intervals shown
- [ ] Key message visible without explanation

**Figure Types for Different Messages:**

| Message Type | Best Figure |
|--------------|-------------|
| Trend/scaling | Line plot with fit |
| Comparison | Bar chart or grouped points |
| Distribution | Histogram or violin plot |
| Relationship | Scatter plot with correlation |
| Process | Flowchart or schematic |
| Complex system | Labeled diagram |

### 3.3 Presentation Timing

For a 30-minute presentation:

| Section | Time | Slides |
|---------|------|--------|
| Title + Outline | 1 min | 2 |
| Introduction/Motivation | 4 min | 4-5 |
| Methods Overview | 4 min | 3-4 |
| Results | 15 min | 10-15 |
| Discussion/Limitations | 3 min | 2-3 |
| Future Work | 3 min | 2-3 |
| **Total** | **30 min** | **25-30** |

**Timing Tips:**
- Practice with timer; cut if over
- Build in 2-minute buffer
- Know which slides to skip if running late
- Better to end slightly early than rush

### 3.4 Backup Slides

Prepare backup slides for:

1. **Additional details** on methods
2. **Supporting data** for key claims
3. **Alternative analyses** of results
4. **Background material** for non-specialists
5. **Anticipated questions**

Organize backup slides by topic with clear labels.

## Part 4: Question Preparation
