# Week 225: Results Consolidation

## Overview

**Days:** 1569-1575 (7 days)
**Theme:** Complete Experiments and Organize Results

Week 225 marks the beginning of the consolidation phase. Your primary objective is to complete all remaining experiments, perform final statistical analyses, and organize your results into a comprehensive, coherent summary that forms the foundation of your research narrative.

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of Week 225, you will be able to:

1. **Complete Experimental Campaigns** - Finish all planned experiments and identify any missing data points
2. **Quantify Uncertainties** - Perform rigorous error analysis and uncertainty propagation
3. **Validate Statistical Claims** - Apply appropriate statistical tests to support your conclusions
4. **Visualize Results** - Create publication-quality figures that communicate findings effectively
5. **Synthesize Findings** - Organize results into a logical narrative structure

### Statistical Validation Framework

| Analysis Type | When to Use | Key Outputs |
|---------------|-------------|-------------|
| Descriptive Statistics | Always | Mean, SD, quartiles |
| t-tests | Comparing two groups | p-value, effect size |
| ANOVA | Comparing multiple groups | F-statistic, post-hoc |
| Regression | Relationships | Coefficients, R-squared |
| Bootstrap | Uncertainty | Confidence intervals |
| Bayesian | Parameter estimation | Posteriors, credible intervals |

### Uncertainty Classification

1. **Type A (Statistical):** From repeated measurements
2. **Type B (Systematic):** From non-statistical sources
3. **Combined:** Root sum of squares of components

---

## Deliverables

- [ ] Complete experimental dataset
- [ ] Statistical analysis report
- [ ] Uncertainty budget document
- [ ] Publication-quality figures (minimum 5)
- [ ] Results Summary (using template)

---

## Resources

### Software for Analysis
- Python: numpy, scipy, pandas, statsmodels
- Visualization: matplotlib, seaborn, plotly
- Statistical: PyMC, arviz, pingouin

### Visualization Guidelines
- Follow journal style guides
- Use colorblind-friendly palettes
- Include error bars/confidence bands
- Label axes clearly with units

---

## Self-Check Questions

1. Are all planned experiments complete?
2. Do you have adequate statistical power?
3. Are uncertainties properly quantified?
4. Do figures clearly communicate findings?
5. Is the results narrative logically organized?
