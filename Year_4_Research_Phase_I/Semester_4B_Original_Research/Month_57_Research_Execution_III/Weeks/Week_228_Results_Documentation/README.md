# Week 228: Results Documentation

## Overview

**Days:** 1590-1596 (7 days)
**Theme:** Technical Report and Comprehensive Documentation

Week 228 concludes the Research Execution phase by creating comprehensive documentation of your results. This includes drafting technical report sections, preparing supplementary materials, creating publication-quality figures, and archiving your complete research package for long-term preservation and reproducibility.

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of Week 228, you will be able to:

1. **Write Technical Reports** - Draft clear, structured sections for your research paper
2. **Create Publication Figures** - Design effective visualizations that communicate key findings
3. **Prepare Supplementary Materials** - Organize additional data and methods for transparency
4. **Enable Reproducibility** - Document all steps needed to reproduce your research
5. **Archive Research** - Prepare research package for long-term preservation

## Key Concepts

### Technical Report Structure

A standard research paper follows this structure:

| Section | Purpose | Length (approx) |
|---------|---------|-----------------|
| Abstract | Summary of entire paper | 150-300 words |
| Introduction | Context, gap, contribution | 1-2 pages |
| Methods | How research was done | 2-4 pages |
| Results | What was found | 2-4 pages |
| Discussion | What it means | 2-3 pages |
| Conclusion | Key takeaways | 0.5-1 page |
| References | Citations | As needed |
| Supplements | Additional material | As needed |

### Figure Types and Uses

| Figure Type | Best For | Guidelines |
|-------------|----------|------------|
| Schematic | Concepts, workflows | Keep simple, labeled |
| Data plot | Quantitative results | Include error bars |
| Comparison | Method benchmarking | Use consistent scales |
| Heatmap | 2D data, correlations | Clear colorbar |
| Diagram | System architecture | Clear labels |

### Reproducibility Hierarchy

```
Level 1: Code Available
    └── Source code on GitHub/Zenodo

Level 2: Environment Specified
    └── requirements.txt, conda env

Level 3: Data Available
    └── Raw data on repository

Level 4: Pipeline Documented
    └── Step-by-step instructions

Level 5: One-Click Reproducible
    └── Containerized, automated
```

## Self-Check Questions

1. Does the abstract accurately summarize the full paper?
2. Are all figures publication-quality and accessible?
3. Can someone reproduce your work from the documentation?
4. Are all data and code properly archived?
5. Have you addressed all reviewer-anticipated concerns?
