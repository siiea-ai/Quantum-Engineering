## Key Activities

### 1. Fresh Read-Through
Print the manuscript or read on a different device. Mark:
- Unclear explanations
- Missing information
- Redundant content
- Flow issues
- Grammar/typo errors

### 2. Technical Verification Checklist
- [ ] All equations numbered correctly
- [ ] Derivation steps are logical and complete
- [ ] Numerical values are consistent throughout
- [ ] Units are correct and consistent
- [ ] Statistical analyses are properly reported
- [ ] Error bars/uncertainties included where appropriate

### 3. Figure Quality Standards
- Resolution: minimum 300 DPI for print
- Font sizes: readable when scaled to column width
- Color scheme: accessible (colorblind-friendly)
- Labels: clear and complete
- Captions: self-contained explanations

### 4. Reference Management
- Use consistent citation style
- Verify DOIs are correct
- Include arXiv identifiers where available
- Check author names and publication years
- Ensure all citations appear in bibliography

## arXiv Submission Overview

### Account Setup
1. Create arXiv account (if not already done)
2. Verify institutional affiliation
3. Confirm endorsement status for category

### Submission Categories
For quantum research, common categories include:
- quant-ph: Quantum Physics
- cond-mat: Condensed Matter
- physics.comp-ph: Computational Physics
- physics.atom-ph: Atomic Physics

### File Preparation
- Main manuscript: LaTeX source files
- Figures: EPS, PDF, or high-resolution PNG
- Bibliography: .bbl file (compiled)
- Supplementary: Ancillary files folder

## Deliverables

| Item | Format | Status |
|------|--------|--------|
| Revised Manuscript | LaTeX + PDF | [ ] |
| Optimized Figures | PDF/EPS | [ ] |
| Complete Bibliography | .bib + .bbl | [ ] |
| Supplementary Materials | Various | [ ] |
| arXiv Submission Package | .tar.gz | [ ] |

## Quality Checklist

### Content Quality
- [ ] Abstract accurately summarizes the work
- [ ] Introduction motivates the research clearly
- [ ] Methods are reproducible from description
- [ ] Results are presented logically
- [ ] Discussion connects to broader field
- [ ] Conclusions are supported by evidence

### Technical Quality
- [ ] All equations are correct
- [ ] Figures are high-resolution
- [ ] Tables are formatted correctly
- [ ] References are complete and accurate
- [ ] Supplementary materials are organized

### Submission Readiness
- [ ] Author information is correct
- [ ] Affiliations are properly listed
- [ ] Acknowledgments include all funding
- [ ] No confidential information included
- [ ] arXiv category selected appropriately

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Rushing the final review** - Take time for careful proofreading
2. **Ignoring figure quality** - Low-resolution figures undermine credibility
3. **Incomplete references** - Missing DOIs or incorrect citations
4. **Overly long abstracts** - Stay within word limits
5. **Missing acknowledgments** - Credit all contributors and funding
