# Journal Selection Guide for Quantum Physics Publications

## Introduction

Selecting the right journal is one of the most consequential decisions in the publication process. The wrong choice can result in desk rejections, misaligned reviewers, reduced visibility, or unnecessary delays. This guide provides a systematic approach to journal selection for quantum physics and quantum engineering research.

## Part II: Journal Selection Criteria

### Primary Selection Factors

#### 1. Scope Alignment (Weight: 30%)

**Questions to Answer:**
- Does the journal publish papers in your specific subfield?
- Have similar papers appeared there recently (past 2-3 years)?
- Is your work within the journal's stated scope?

**Verification Method:**
1. Search journal for 5 related keywords
2. Identify 3-5 similar papers published there
3. Read journal's "Aims and Scope" statement
4. Check if scope covers both your methods and applications

**Red Flags:**
- No papers on your topic in past 3 years
- Scope statement excludes your methodology
- Recent editorial changes shifting focus away

#### 2. Audience Match (Weight: 25%)

**Questions to Answer:**
- Who do you want to read your paper?
- Where does your target audience publish?
- What journals do you cite most frequently?

**Verification Method:**
1. Analyze your reference list - which journals appear most?
2. Ask colleagues where they would look for such work
3. Consider interdisciplinary reach vs. depth of expertise

**Audience Types:**
- **Specialists:** Physical Review A, Quantum
- **Broader physics:** Physical Review Letters, PRX
- **Interdisciplinary:** Nature Communications, Science Advances
- **Applied/Industry:** Physical Review Applied, Applied Physics Letters

#### 3. Impact and Visibility (Weight: 20%)

**Metrics to Consider:**
- Impact Factor (citations per paper over 2 years)
- Eigenfactor (weighted citation network importance)
- Altmetric attention (social media, news, policy)
- Download statistics

**Balanced Assessment:**
- Highest IF is not always best choice
- Consider field-normalized metrics
- Visibility among target audience matters more than raw numbers
- Emerging journals may offer faster impact despite lower IF

#### 4. Turnaround Time (Weight: 15%)

**Typical Timelines:**
| Stage | Letters | Regular Articles |
|-------|---------|------------------|
| Initial decision | 2-4 weeks | 4-8 weeks |
| Review cycle | 6-12 weeks | 8-16 weeks |
| Revision & response | 4-8 weeks | 6-12 weeks |
| Production | 2-4 weeks | 4-8 weeks |
| **Total** | **3-7 months** | **6-12 months** |

**Timeline Considerations:**
- Degree completion deadlines
- Conference presentation dates
- Grant reporting requirements
- Priority/scooping concerns

#### 5. Acceptance Rates (Weight: 10%)

**Typical Acceptance Rates:**
- Nature/Science: ~7%
- Physical Review Letters: ~25%
- Physical Review X: ~15%
- Physical Review A/B: ~60%
- Regular specialty journals: ~50-70%

**Strategic Thinking:**
- Higher rejection rates mean more time if rejected
- Consider backup plan before submission
- Track record with similar papers from your group

### Secondary Selection Factors

#### Review Quality
- Constructive vs. dismissive reviews
- Expertise of typical reviewers
- Journal's response to review disputes

#### Formatting Requirements
- LaTeX template availability
- Figure requirements
- Reference style complexity
- Word/page limits

#### Journal Reputation
- Perception in hiring/tenure committees
- Advisor's experience
- Field-specific prestige considerations

## Part III: The Decision Process

### Step 1: Create Initial List

1. List all journals where similar work has appeared
2. Add journals from your reference list
