## Key Concepts

### The Discussion Section

**Purpose:** Interpret your results in context

**Structure:**
1. **Summary of main findings** (brief recap)
2. **Interpretation** (what results mean)
3. **Comparison with prior work** (agreement/disagreement)
4. **Limitations** (honest assessment)
5. **Implications** (what this enables)
6. **Future directions** (what comes next)

**Key Differences from Results:**

| Results | Discussion |
|---------|------------|
| What you found | What it means |
| Objective presentation | Interpretation |
| Data description | Data significance |
| Comparison with theory | Explanation of differences |

### The Conclusions Section

**Purpose:** Summarize and provide closure

**Content:**
1. Restate main achievement (1-2 sentences)
2. Key supporting results (2-3 sentences)
3. Significance (1-2 sentences)
4. Future outlook (1-2 sentences)

**Difference from Abstract:**
- Abstract: Complete summary for deciding whether to read
- Conclusions: Summary for reader who has read paper; emphasizes implications

### The Abstract

**Purpose:** Complete, standalone summary enabling relevance assessment

**Structure (150-250 words typically):**
```
Context (1-2 sentences): Why this matters
Problem (1 sentence): What challenge is addressed
Approach (1 sentence): What you did
Results (2-3 sentences): What you found
Implications (1 sentence): Why it's significant
```

**Writing Order:** Write LAST, after the full paper is complete

## Common Challenges

### "My Discussion just repeats the Results"

Discussion should interpret, not repeat. Ask: "What do these results mean? Why did we get these results? What can we now do that we couldn't before?" Focus on significance and context.

### "I don't know what to put in Conclusions vs. Abstract"

Abstract: For reader deciding whether to read (must be complete summary)
Conclusions: For reader who has read paper (emphasizes significance and outlook)

### "My Abstract is too long"

Cut background to essentials. Reduce results to key numbers. Combine sentences. Every word must earn its place.

### "I can't finish in time"

Prioritize: A complete rough draft is better than a polished incomplete one. Focus on having all sections present. Revision is next month's focus.

## Writing Tips for This Week

### Discussion

1. Start with your most important finding
2. Be honest about limitations
3. Don't overclaim beyond your data
4. Connect to broader implications
5. Suggest concrete next steps

### Conclusions

1. Be brief but substantive
2. Don't introduce new information
3. End on forward-looking note
4. Match tone to journal style

### Abstract

1. Write multiple drafts
2. Cut ruthlessly
3. Use active voice
4. Include one key number
5. Test: Can someone understand your contribution from Abstract alone?

## Connection to Revision (Month 59)

Your first draft sets up Month 59's revision work. A complete draft enables:

- Comprehensive feedback from advisor
- Structured revision approach
- Targeted improvement of weak sections
- Realistic timeline for submission

Document issues you notice for future revision rather than trying to fix everything now.

## Quality Assessment

**First Draft Quality Expectations:**

| Aspect | Expected State |
|--------|---------------|
| Completeness | All sections present |
| Accuracy | Technical content correct |
| Clarity | Main points understandable |
| Polish | Rough; will improve in revision |
| Length | May be over/under limit |

The goal is "good enough to revise," not "ready to submit."
