# Week 231: Introduction & Background

## Overview

**Days:** 1611-1617 (7 days)
**Theme:** Framing Your Contribution in Context
**Deliverable:** Complete Introduction section

This week focuses on the Introduction—often the most challenging section to write. The Introduction must accomplish multiple goals: engage readers, establish context, identify the gap your work addresses, and clearly state your contribution. Writing it after Methods and Results is strategic: you now know exactly what you need to introduce.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this week, you will be able to:

1. **Synthesize background literature** into a coherent narrative
2. **Identify and articulate the gap** your work addresses
3. **Write a compelling hook** that engages diverse readers
4. **State your contribution** clearly and specifically
5. **Create narrative flow** from broad context to specific contribution

## Key Concepts

### The Funnel Structure

The Introduction follows a funnel from broad to specific:

```
Paragraph 1: BROAD - Why does this field matter?
     ↓
Paragraph 2-3: NARROWER - What has been done?
     ↓
Paragraph 4: SPECIFIC - What's missing?
     ↓
Paragraph 5: YOUR WORK - What do you contribute?
     ↓
Paragraph 6 (optional): ROADMAP - How is the paper organized?
```

### Paragraph Functions

| Paragraph | Function | Key Question |
|-----------|----------|--------------|
| 1 (Hook) | Engage reader | "Why should I care?" |
| 2-3 (Background) | Establish context | "What's known?" |
| 4 (Gap) | Create tension | "What's missing?" |
| 5 (Contribution) | Resolve tension | "What do you add?" |
| 6 (Roadmap) | Guide reader | "Where are we going?" |

### The Gap-Contribution Connection

The gap and contribution must connect directly:

**Good Connection:**
```
Gap: "Previous methods require O(n²) scaling, limiting practical
applications beyond 50 qubits."

Contribution: "We present a method achieving O(n log n) scaling,
enabling simulations of 1000+ qubits on standard hardware."
```

**Weak Connection:**
```
Gap: "Little is known about system X under condition Y."

Contribution: "We study system X under condition Y."
[Missing: What did you find? Why does it matter?]
```

## Self-Assessment Checklist

### Hook and Context

- [ ] Opening sentence is engaging and accessible
- [ ] Broad significance is established
- [ ] Connection to real-world applications or fundamental science is clear
- [ ] Appropriate citations support context claims

### Background

- [ ] Key prior work is cited
- [ ] Literature is synthesized, not just listed
- [ ] Background builds logically toward gap
- [ ] Treatment of prior work is fair and balanced
- [ ] Recent relevant papers are included

### Gap Statement

- [ ] Gap is clearly stated
- [ ] Gap follows logically from background
- [ ] Significance of gap is explained
- [ ] Gap is specific enough to address

### Contribution Statement

- [ ] Contribution is clearly stated
- [ ] Contribution directly addresses stated gap
- [ ] Key results are previewed with specifics
- [ ] Contribution is distinguished from prior work
- [ ] Claims are supported by paper's results

### Flow and Writing

- [ ] Logical flow from broad to specific
- [ ] Smooth transitions between paragraphs
- [ ] Consistent terminology throughout
- [ ] Appropriate length for target journal
- [ ] No jargon undefined for target audience

## Common Challenges

### "I can't make my work sound important"

Connect your specific work to broader significance. Ask: "Who benefits from this result? What does it enable? What question does it answer?" If your work is incremental, be honest about the scope while still noting genuine contributions.

### "My background section is too long"

Synthesize rather than list. Group related papers into themes. Focus on work most directly related to your contribution. Move extended background to a "Background" section if needed.

### "I'm not sure what the gap is"

Complete this sentence: "Despite progress in X, we still don't know/can't do Y." The Y is your gap. If you can't identify a gap, consider whether your work makes a novel contribution.

### "I keep repeating what others say in reviews"

Write the narrative first, then add citations. Focus on what the reader needs to know, not what each paper says. Use citations to support your narrative, not drive it.

## Writing Tips for This Week

### Opening Sentences

**Strong Opening Patterns:**
- Statement of significance: "Quantum computers promise..."
- State of the field: "Over the past decade, X has transformed..."
- Fundamental question: "Understanding X remains a central challenge..."

**Weak Openings to Avoid:**
- Starting with "In this paper..." (save for contribution paragraph)
- Too technical without context
- Clichéd phrases ("It is well known that...")

### Citation Practices

**Synthesized Citations:**
```
"Significant progress has been made in superconducting qubit
coherence times, with T1 values now routinely exceeding
100 μs [refs] and approaching 1 ms in optimized devices [ref]."
```

**Listing (Avoid):**
```
"Smith et al. [1] studied X. Jones et al. [2] also studied X.
Brown et al. [3] found similar results..."
```

### Active Voice

**Prefer:**
```
"We demonstrate a method that achieves..."
"Our approach overcomes the limitation by..."
"This paper presents evidence for..."
```

**Avoid Excessive Passive:**
```
"A method is demonstrated that..."
"The limitation is overcome by..."
"Evidence is presented for..."
```

## Connection to Other Sections

The Introduction must align with other sections:

| Introduction States | Section Delivers |
|--------------------|--------------------|
| "We measure X" | Methods describes how |
| "We find Y" | Results presents Y |
| "This enables Z" | Discussion interprets |
| "Gap is..." | Your work addresses it |

Read your Methods and Results before finalizing the Introduction to ensure consistency.

## Advisor Interaction

Share your Introduction draft with your advisor, asking for feedback on:

1. Is the hook effective for the target journal?
2. Is the background appropriately scoped?
3. Is the gap clearly and fairly stated?
4. Is the contribution accurately represented?
5. Are there any overstatements or understatements?

The Introduction sets expectations for your entire paper. Invest the time to get it right.
