## The Research Phase Paradigm Shift

### From Learning to Creating

| Years 0-3 | Year 4 |
|-----------|--------|
| Structured daily lessons | Self-directed research |
| Problem sets with known answers | Open-ended investigation |
| Learning established knowledge | Creating new knowledge |
| Following curriculum | Defining research direction |
| Assessment by exams | Assessment by output (papers, code) |
| Guided by textbooks | Guided by literature and advisors |

### What Makes Research Different

1. **No answer key exists** — You're exploring unknown territory
2. **Failure is common** — Most ideas don't work; this is normal
3. **Writing is central** — You communicate through papers, not exams
4. **Collaboration matters** — Research is rarely done in isolation
5. **Time management is crucial** — No one structures your day

## Year 4 Content Structure

Year 4 uses a fundamentally different structure from Years 0-3:

### Weekly Research Log Format

```
Week_XXX_Topic/
├── README.md                    # Week objectives and plan
├── Research_Log.md              # Daily progress notes
├── Reading_Notes/               # Literature reading notes
├── Code/                        # Implementation work
├── Results/                     # Outputs and data
└── Reflection.md                # Weekly reflection
```

### Monthly Deliverables

| Month | Primary Deliverable |
