## Core Concepts

### What is a Transversal Gate?

A **transversal gate** is a logical operation implemented by applying independent physical operations to each qubit in a code block:

$$\boxed{\bar{U} = U_1 \otimes U_2 \otimes \cdots \otimes U_n}$$

For identical operations on each qubit:

$$\boxed{\bar{U} = U^{\otimes n}}$$

**Key Property:** Transversal gates do not spread errors between qubits within a code block.

### Why Transversal Gates Are Fault-Tolerant

Consider a single-qubit error $E_i$ on qubit $i$:

1. Before transversal gate: Error on qubit $i$ only
2. After transversal gate: $U^{\otimes n} E_i = (U E_i U^\dagger) U^{\otimes n}$
3. Result: Still a single-qubit error on qubit $i$

**No error propagation** = natural fault tolerance.

### The Clifford Group

The **Clifford group** $\mathcal{C}_n$ is generated by:
- Hadamard: $H$
- Phase: $S = \sqrt{Z}$
- CNOT: $\text{CNOT}_{ij}$

**Key Property:** Cliffords map Paulis to Paulis:
$$C P C^\dagger \in \mathcal{P}_n \quad \forall C \in \mathcal{C}_n, P \in \mathcal{P}_n$$

### The T-Gate Problem

The **T-gate** (or $\pi/8$ gate):
$$T = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & e^{i\pi/4} \end{pmatrix}$$

- NOT in the Clifford group
- Clifford + T = **universal**
- T is NOT transversal on any CSS code

### Eastin-Knill Theorem (Informal)

> **No quantum error-correcting code can have a transversal gate set that is universal for quantum computation.**

This is a fundamental no-go theorem for fault-tolerant quantum computing.

## Key Equations

**Transversal Gate Definition:**
$$\boxed{\bar{U} = \bigotimes_{i=1}^n U_i \quad \text{where } U_i \text{ acts on qubit } i \text{ only}}$$

**CSS Transversal X:**
$$\boxed{\bar{X} = X^{\otimes n}}$$

**CSS Transversal Z:**
$$\boxed{\bar{Z} = Z^{\otimes n}}$$

**Transversal CNOT (between blocks):**
$$\boxed{\overline{\text{CNOT}} = \text{CNOT}^{\otimes n}}$$

**Eastin-Knill Theorem:**
$$\boxed{\text{Transversal gates form discrete subgroup of } SU(2^k) \implies \text{Not universal}}$$

## Summary

Week 123 addresses a fundamental question in fault-tolerant quantum computing: **Why can't we just use transversal gates for everything?** The Eastin-Knill theorem provides a definitive answer: no quantum code can have a transversal universal gate set. This forces us to use more complex techniques like magic state injection or code switching to achieve universality. Understanding this limitation is essential for designing practical fault-tolerant quantum computers.
