# Week 142: Research Frontiers (2025-2026)

## Month 36, Week 2 | Days 988-994

### Week Overview

This week surveys the cutting-edge research frontiers in quantum computing as of 2025-2026. We analyze recent milestones from major industry players and academic groups, critically evaluate quantum advantage claims, examine error correction demonstrations, and identify open problems that will shape the field's future. This is a "current events" week focused on synthesizing recent developments and projecting future directions.

### Learning Objectives

1. **Evaluate** logical qubit demonstrations from Google, IBM, Quantinuum, and others
2. **Critically analyze** quantum advantage claims and classical competition
3. **Compare** different approaches to fault-tolerant quantum computing
4. **Assess** hardware scaling trajectories across platforms
5. **Identify** the most promising algorithmic and software advances
6. **Articulate** key open problems and research directions for 2026-2030
