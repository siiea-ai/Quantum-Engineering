## Summary

Week 144 is simultaneously an ending and a beginning. We complete Year 2's intensive coursework while laying the foundation for Year 3's research focus. The week emphasizes the transition from knowledge acquisition to knowledge creation, from learning established results to developing new ones.

The qualifying exam preparation begins with understanding the format and expectations. Research skills development focuses on proposal writing and literature review. The capstone project demonstrates your Year 2 mastery, while Day 1008's celebration acknowledges the tremendous accomplishment of completing two years of PhD-level quantum science education.

You are now prepared to transition from student to researcher. Year 3 awaits.
