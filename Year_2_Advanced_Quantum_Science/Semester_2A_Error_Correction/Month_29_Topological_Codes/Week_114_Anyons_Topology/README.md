# Week 114: Anyons & Topological Order

## Year 2, Semester 2A: Quantum Error Correction
### Month 29: Topological Codes
### Days 792-798

## Week Overview

This week explores the fascinating world of **anyons**—exotic quasiparticles that exist only in two-dimensional systems and exhibit statistics beyond the familiar bosonic and fermionic categories. We develop the complete theory of anyonic excitations in the toric code, understand their braiding and fusion properties, and connect these concepts to the deeper notion of topological order.

The toric code harbors three types of nontrivial anyonic excitations: **e-particles** (electric charges), **m-particles** (magnetic fluxes), and their bound state **ε** (epsilon-fermions). Understanding how these particles braid and fuse provides the mathematical foundation for topological quantum computation, where quantum gates are implemented through particle exchanges rather than direct manipulation of qubits.

## Key Mathematical Objects

### Anyon Types in Toric Code
$$\mathcal{A} = \{1, e, m, \varepsilon\}$$

### Fusion Rules
$$e \times e = 1, \quad m \times m = 1, \quad e \times m = \varepsilon$$

### Braiding Phase (e around m)
$$R_{em} = e^{i\pi} = -1$$

### Topological Entanglement Entropy
$$S_{\text{topo}} = -\log D = -\log 2$$
