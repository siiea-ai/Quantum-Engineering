The year is divided into two critical phases: completing a second research project and writing/defending your doctoral thesis.

**Days:** 1681-2016 (336 days, 12 months)
**Months:** 61-72
**Weeks:** 241-288
**Purpose:** Complete second research project, write thesis, and successfully defend

### Mock Defense Protocol

**Conduct 3-5 mock defenses in Month 70:**

```
Mock 1 (Week 277): Focus on presentation clarity
- Present to yourself, record, and review
- Time each section
- Identify unclear explanations

Mock 2 (Week 278): Focus on technical depth
- Imagine tough technical questions
- Practice whiteboard derivations
- Test edge cases of your knowledge

Mock 3 (Week 279): Focus on big picture
- Why does this matter?
- What are the limitations?
- Where does the field go from here?

Mock 4 (Week 280): Full simulation
- Complete talk + 30 minutes Q&A
- Have someone play "difficult committee member"
- Practice handling unknown questions gracefully
```

### Question Response Strategies

**For questions you know well:**
- Answer directly and confidently
- Provide examples if helpful
- Keep answers focused (2-3 minutes max)

**For questions you know partially:**
- Acknowledge what you know
- Explain your reasoning process
- Connect to related concepts you know well

**For questions you don't know:**
- "That's an interesting question. I haven't explored that directly, but here's how I would approach it..."
- "I'm not certain, but my intuition is..."
- "That's a great point for future work..."

**Never:**
- Pretend to know something you don't
- Give overly long, meandering answers
- Become defensive
