## Part 1: Institutional Research Requirements

### 1.1 Quantum Science and Engineering (QSE) PhD

**Source:** [Harvard GSAS QSE Policy](https://gsas.harvard.edu/policy/quantum-science-and-engineering) | [Harvard SEAS PhD Requirements](https://seas.harvard.edu/office-academic-programs/graduate-policies-procedures-and-forms/phd-degree-requirements/phd-research-advisors-committees-and-meetings)

#### Post-Qualifying Exam Requirements
- **Oral Examination:** Students must pass an oral exam given by the Qualifying Exam Committee (QEC), ideally by the end of the fourth term in residence
- **Examination Focus:** General knowledge, reasoning, ability to formulate a research plan, and ability to engage in high-level scientific discourse
- **Specialization Requirement:** Students must select, prepare, and discuss in depth a topic in their specialization field

#### Thesis Committee Structure
Harvard uses a multi-tiered advisory system:

| Committee | Role | Composition |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| **Student Advisory Committee (SAC)** | Oversees advising process for all students | Faculty committee |
| **Individual Advisory Committee (IAC)** | Created by SAC for each student | Student-specific faculty |
| **Thesis Advisory Committee (TAC)** | Approved by SAC; guides thesis research | Research-focused faculty |

#### Research Milestones
1. **Laboratory Rotations:** Complete before selecting thesis advisor
2. **Thesis Advisor Selection:** Must be a QSE Core Faculty Member or related department faculty (Physics, CS, EE, Materials Science, Chemistry, Mathematics)
3. **Annual Committee Meetings:** Required 1:1 meetings with committee members or full committee meetings (varies by area)
4. **Thesis Submission:** Draft copies must be provided to dissertation committee at least 3 weeks before examination
5. **Timeline:** PhD ideally completed within 6.5 years; minimum 2 years full-time enrollment

#### Publication Expectations

### 1.2 MIT Physics PhD Research Phase

**Source:** [MIT Physics Doctoral Guidelines](https://physics.mit.edu/academic-programs/graduate-students/doctoral-guidelines/) | [MIT Physics Graduate Advising](https://physics.mit.edu/about-physics/policies-and-procedures/graduate-advising/)

#### Research Advisor Selection
- **Dual Advisor System:** Each incoming student is assigned an academic advisor; later, a research supervisor becomes primary
- **Flexibility:** Unlike biology/chemistry, physics does not have formal rotations, but students can create their own rotation schedules
- **Provisional Arrangements:** Faculty often invite students to work on a provisional basis to test fit
- **Importance of Fit:** Passion and excitement about the specific research topic are critical factors

#### Qualifying Examinations
The PhD requires a doctoral examination with two components:

| Component | Options | Timing |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| **Written Exam** | Pass 4 subject exams OR pass designated classes with qualifying grade | Early years |
| **Oral Exam** | Given in student's research specialty area | 2nd or 3rd year |

- Passing the Oral Exam designates the student as a "PhD Candidate"
- The exam assesses deep understanding of central ideas in the specialty area

#### Thesis Requirements
- **Thesis Committee:** Must be assigned no later than one term after passing oral exam
- **Committee Meeting:** Initial meeting required no later than 4 weeks before last day of classes
- **Thesis Defense:** Not required; thesis graded by research supervisor in consultation with committee
- **Departmental Reader:** Assigned to evaluate thesis independently

#### Annual Progress Reviews
- Committee meetings monitor research progress
- No formal university-wide "PhD Review Days" in physics (unlike Computer Science)
