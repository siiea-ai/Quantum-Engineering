# Year 3: Qualifying Exam Preparation — Comprehensive Plan

## Executive Summary

Year 3 marks a fundamental shift in the curriculum. Unlike Years 0-2 which focused on **knowledge acquisition**, Year 3 focuses on **knowledge consolidation, synthesis, and mastery demonstration**. This mirrors the transition PhD students make from coursework to candidacy.

**Days:** 1009-1344 (336 days, 12 months)
**Months:** 37-48
**Weeks:** 145-192
**Purpose:** Pass the qualifying examination and transition to research phase

## Understanding the Qualifying Exam

### What It Is

The PhD qualifying exam ("quals") is the gateway to candidacy. It tests whether a student has:

1. **Mastery** of foundational material (not just familiarity)
2. **Synthesis** ability (connecting disparate topics)
3. **Research potential** (ability to think independently)
4. **Scientific communication** (explaining complex ideas clearly)

### Harvard QSE Format (Our Model)

Based on [Harvard QSE policy](https://gsas.harvard.edu/policy/quantum-science-and-engineering):
- **Oral examination** by end of fourth term
- **General knowledge + specialized topic** format
- Student **selects and prepares** a topic in depth
- Faculty ask questions about topic AND broader subfield
- Tests **reasoning and scientific discourse**, not just recall

### MIT Physics Format (Reference)

Based on [MIT Physics Guidelines](https://physics.mit.edu/academic-programs/graduate-students/doctoral-guidelines/):
- **Oral exam**, 120 minutes duration
- **Assigned topic** (2 weeks prep) + general questions
- Topics drawn primarily from **Nielsen & Chuang**
- Committee of three faculty members
- 4-6 weeks integrated preparation time

## Year 3 Philosophy: Different From Years 0-2

### The Shift

| Years 0-2 | Year 3 |
|-----------|--------|
| Learn new material daily | Review and deepen existing material |
| Sequential topic coverage | Cross-cutting integration |
| Theory + problems + labs | Problems + oral practice + writing |
| Building knowledge | Demonstrating mastery |
| Consumption | Production |

### What This Means Practically

1. **Less new content, more synthesis** — We're not learning HHL for the first time; we're asking "How does HHL connect to phase estimation, which connects to eigenvalue problems, which connects to quantum chemistry?"

2. **Oral communication focus** — Year 3 includes regular practice of explaining concepts verbally, simulating the oral exam format.

3. **Problem-solving intensive** — Qualifying exams test problem-solving under pressure. Year 3 features extensive practice with exam-style problems.

4. **Research preview** — The qualifying exam includes a research proposal component. Year 3 includes research methodology training.

## Differences from Standard Curriculum

Year 3 differs fundamentally:

1. **No new day files** — Year 3 uses review guides, problem sets, and practice exams instead of daily content files

2. **Week-based structure** — Organized by topic review rather than day-by-day progression

3. **Problem-focused** — Each week includes 20-30 qualifying exam problems

4. **Oral practice integration** — Regular spoken explanations and mock orals

5. **Assessment-driven** — Monthly exams with real qualifying exam format

---

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Structure Creation
- Create Year_3_Qualifying_Exam/ directory
- Create semester and month subdirectories
- Create week-based README files with topics and problems

### Phase 2: Problem Set Compilation
- Curate problems from university qualifying exams
- Organize by topic and difficulty
- Create solution guides

### Phase 3: Practice Exam Creation
- Develop monthly written exams
- Create oral exam question banks
- Establish grading rubrics

### Phase 4: Mock Exam System
- Full qualifying exam simulations
- Self-assessment frameworks
- Progress tracking

---

## Success Metrics

By completing Year 3, you should be able to:

1. **Pass a written qualifying exam** with 80%+ score
2. **Pass an oral qualifying exam** with clear, confident responses
3. **Explain any core topic** to a non-expert in 5 minutes
4. **Solve novel problems** by combining multiple concepts
5. **Identify research directions** and write a basic proposal

---

## Connection to Research Phase (Years 4-5)

Year 3 bridges coursework and research:

| Year 3 Skill | Year 4-5 Application |
|--------------|---------------------|
| Literature review | Research topic selection |
| Problem solving | Research methodology |
| Oral communication | Thesis defense |
| Proposal writing | Grant applications |
| Integration | Original contributions |
