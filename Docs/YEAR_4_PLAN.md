# Year 4: Research Phase I — Comprehensive Plan

## Executive Summary

Year 4 marks the most significant transition in the curriculum: from structured coursework to **independent research**. This mirrors the PhD student's journey after passing qualifying exams, beginning the process of contributing original knowledge to the field.

**Days:** 1345-1680 (336 days)
**Months:** 49-60
**Weeks:** 193-240
**Purpose:** Conduct original research and produce first academic output

## The Research Phase Paradigm Shift

### From Coursework to Research

| Years 0-3 | Year 4 |
|-----------|--------|
| Structured daily lessons | Self-directed research |
| Problem sets with known answers | Open-ended investigation |
| Learning established knowledge | Creating new knowledge |
| Following curriculum | Defining research direction |
| Assessment by exams | Assessment by output (papers, code) |
| Guided by textbooks | Guided by literature and advisors |

### What Makes Research Different

1. **No answer key exists** — You're exploring unknown territory
2. **Failure is common** — Most ideas don't work; this is normal
3. **Writing is central** — You communicate through papers, not exams
4. **Collaboration matters** — Research is rarely done in isolation
5. **Time management is crucial** — No one structures your day
